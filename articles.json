Tidally locked to its star, one of its sides is in permanent daylight, and the other in permanent night. During the Xi'an-Human Cold War (SEY 2530 - 2793), Human military intelligence identified a facility located on the dark side of Ku\u0101'li that saw frequent traffic and was under heavy guard. Reports suggested that it was a maximum security labor camp. In 2788, the facility was suddenly torn down and the planet left unguarded. The Xi'an Empire denies that they operated a labor camp on Ku\u0101'li, but have not offered an alternate explanation of its purpose.\n",
    "Kyle Polo": "Kyle Polo (2883 - present) served as Senator of Angeli (Croshaw II) from 2935 to 2945. During his time in office, he voted for legislation that decreased government spending and lowered taxes for big and small businesses on Angeli. His largest piece of legislation, the Polo Initiative, was aimed at curtailing the military budget by placing it under Senate review. Though it initially gathered support, the legislation was voted down on the 4 November 2945 ballot following a Vanduulattack on the Vega system. Polo, up for election on that same ballot, was voted out of office.\n",
    "350r": "The 350r is a variant of the 300 series developed by Origin Jumpworks. Designed by Andreas Lang, a limited run of prototypes were initially created and distributed to racing teams to promote the use of the 300i as a high performance platform. Met with unexpected success, Origin began constructing them for a wider customer base, though still in much smaller manufacturer runs than the other 300 series subtypes. The design is easily identifiable compared to other 300i variants because it has twin main thrusters instead of a single drive plume.\n",

A smog planet, it is enveloped in layers of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and sulfur dioxide. In the distant past, its surface was too dangerous to land a ship on due to the highly pressure atmosphere. Since the red giant in La'uo's center expanded and began to heat up the system, Kyu'\u0101m's atmosphere has thinned and expanded, giving it the appearance of a miniature hot Jupiter.\n",
    "600i Touring": "The 600i Touring is a variant of the 600 series of spacecraft developed by Origin Jumpworks. It was designed for leisure travel. In exchange for a reduced cargo capacity, it features luxury living quarters outfitted with furniture from high-end design firm Tatavo, along with other passenger-facing amenities.\n",
    "Kyuk'ya Belt Alpha": "The Kyuk\u2019ya belt alpha is an asteroid belt in the Kyuk'ya system, Xi'an Empire. Some of the larger asteroids are occupied by members of the nyayu'a, the professional class of criminals who operate with the conditional approval and oversight of the Xi'an government. People conducting inter-civilization business at the trade hub Pyen'pui.a on Pue'nu (Kyuk'ya 1a) sometimes hire information dealers, bodyguards, mercenaries, loan collectors, or other nyayu'a who operate from the Kyuk'ya belt alpha when the need arises.\n",
    "85x": "The 85X is a touring vessel manufactured by Origin Jumpworks. It features performance handling and a wide field of view for its pilot and single passenger. Intended initially as a companion away-craft for the 890 Jump, it has since become available to a wider market as a standalone runabout.\n",
    "Kyuk'ya I": "Kyuk'ya I is a gas giant in the Kyuk'ya system, Xi'an Empire, and is the closest planet to its suns. Orbited by a far-reaching set of rings composed of rock and ice, the sight of the binary stars at the center of Kyuk'ya against the dramatic backdrop of these rings has been a recurring subject in Xi'an poetry since it was first discovered in MXY III.826 (SEY 2515). The Xi'an government requires that any new space stations built in support of intersystem trade must be placed in orbital positions that will not mar the natural beauty of the rings.\n",
    "890 Jump": "The 890 Jump is a luxury civilian spacecraft built by Origin Jumpworks. With its exterior designed to reference the nautical lines of ocean-borne vessels, the interior is outfitted with luxury accommodations that include multiple bedrooms for passengers and crew.

    "Kyuk'ya II": "Kyuk'ya II is the second planet from the suns of the Kyuk'ya system, Xi'an Empire. Due to its acutely tilted axis, it experiences extreme variation in its seasons. For nearly a quarter of each year, the suns shine directly over one of the poles, plunging the rest of the planet into a lengthy and dark winter. When the suns reappear in the sky during the spring, they generate powerful heat and storms that cause catastrophic floods and lay waste to the landscape.\n",
    "\u0100i se Cho'an": "\u0100i se Cho'an (MXY III.726 - III.874? / SEY 2386 - 2577?) was a navjumper best known for her discovery of the Y\u0101'mon system. Born into a House that specialized in jump point navigation, \u0100i was trained from a young age in navigational techniques and began her career hunting for potential jump points when she completed her civil service in MXY III.796 (SEY 2477). Her discovery of the Y\u0101'mon system in MXY III.837 (SEY 2529) earned her the status of Matriarch at the young age of 111. \u0100i disappeared in MXY III.874 (SEY 2577) while traveling in the T.\u0101l system. Historians of House Cho'an maintain that she likely fell victim to an accident while navigating a yet-to-be-discovered jump point. House Cho'an has made it a rite of passage for their members to complete a year-long tour in T.\u0101l, hoping to locate what \u0100i may have found.\n",
    "Kyuk'ya System": "The Kyuk'ya system, also called the Indra system, is a planetary system in the Xi'an Empire that consists of an A-type main sequence star, a white dwarf, a gas giant, a terrestrial planet, and an asteroid belt. Discovered in MXY III.826 (SEY 2515) when a Xi'an military convoy picked up an anomalous signature during a routine mining escort operation in the Y\u0101'mon system, it was incorporated into the Perry Line and SEY 2548 when the United Empire of Earth (UEE) became aware of the Kyuk'ya-Y\u0101'mon jump point. The UEE gave it the military designation Indra after an ancient Human god of war. Following the end of the Xi'an-Human Cold War (SEY 2530 - 2793), the UEE updated their charts to reflect the system's original Xi'an name. Kyuk'ya was made into a center of trade between the Xi'an Empire, the UEE, and the Banu Protectorate. The largest settlement in the system, located on the moon Pue'nu (Kyuk'ya 1a), is a center of Xi'an youth culture.\n",
    "A Gift for Baba": "A Gift for Baba is Human morality tale coined in the late 2300s. There are many versions of the story, but the best known version was adapted into a children's book of the same name by Fatima Reynolds-Malik in 2480. In it, three siblings, all children, travel from Mars (Sol IV) to Europa (Sol 5b) to deliver the perfect gift to their Grandmother, \"Baba.\"\n",
    "La'uo System": "The La'uo system (Hui sen La'uo) is a planetary system in the Xi'an Empire (SaoXy'an) that consists of a red giant, three terrestrial planets, two asteroid belts, and a gas giant. In MXY III.1017 (SEY 2759), a group of Xi'an outlaws discovered a jump point from the \u0112'aluth system into La'uo and made it into their base of operations. Although the Xi'an government learned of the system's existence soon afterwards, they declined to claim it due to its lack of terraformable planets. It became a part of the Perry Line in MXY III.1026 (SEY 2771) when the UEE military detected a jump point from the Tohil system system to La'uo, forcing the outlaws that lived there to flee as military ships from both sides of the Xi'an-Human Cold War (SEY 2530 - 2793 / MXY III.838 - III.1044) flooded in and took their place. In MXY III.1040 (SEY 2789), Emperor T.u\u0113ng se Kr.\u0113 traveled through La'uo on his way to the Tohil system, where he and Senator Terrence Akari of the United Empire of Earth (UEE) negotiated the terms of what would become known as the Akari-Kr.\u0113 treaty. The same pirate gangs who once lived in La'uo played a key role in ensuring that Kr.\u0113 could pass through the system and into Tohil undetected. In return, Kr.\u0113 recognized these pirate gangs as nyayu'a and granted them dominion over the La'uo system with the exception of the planet Yengchuai (La\u2019uo II).\n",

Most of the new population centers are fortified against attacks from the gangs that have not yet been forced out of Nexus.\n",
    "Aadya Firmino": "Aadya Firmino (SEY 2692 - 2781) was the CEO of Terra Movers Construction and a smuggler best known for her 2716 discovery of the Tohil system with her business partner Oisha Suen. In 2713, seeking adventure after a sheltered childhood, she flew her new Constellation Andromeda to Delamar in the Nyx system, where she met pilot and mechanic Oisha Suen. Over the next three years, they ran a smuggling operation in which Firmino made increasingly brazen attempts to steal clientele from other established smugglers in the Nyx system. She and Suen were exiled after a last attempt that destroyed one of Levski's ports and left three people gravely injured. A few days later, Suen picked up the signal of an anomaly that proved to be a jump point to a previously undiscovered planetary system. Firmino convinced Suen to keep this a secret until they were able to assess the full extent of what they had found. She then took Suen to the Bremen system, plied her with alcohol, and reported the discovery to the United Empire of Earth (UEE) government, claiming that she'd done it on her own. She enjoyed a short period of public adulation until a tell-all interview with Suen was published in the Terra Gazette. The Department of Transportation and Navigation conducted an investigation and reassigned credit for the discovery to both Firmino and Suen. Shortly after this, the Advocacy issued warrants for both smugglers' arrests. While Suen served a reduced sentence in exchange for providing a truthful testimony, Firmino ultimately avoided jail time thanks to her team of lawyers. She attempted to go back to Levski in 2723, but was denied entry. After returning to Terra (Terra III), she joined her father's company, inheriting it and becoming the new CEO when he passed away in 2736.\n",
    "Lanes": "Lanes, or space lanes, are the common transit paths for spacecraft within solar systems. They are most commonly used by commercial spacecraft carrying freight or passengers, along with military and other ships. With few exceptions, lanes are typically the shortest path between two points that can be safely navigated. Lanes are considered the safest areas for in-system travel because their more highly trafficked nature and higher rate of security patrol dissuades all but the boldest pirates.\n",
    "Aaron Halo (Stanton Belt Alpha)": "The Aaron Halo (Stanton belt alpha) is a dense asteroid belt in the Stanton system that falls between the orbits of Crusader (Stanton II) and ArcCorp (Stanton III). After Crusader Industries purchased Stanton II from the United Empire of Earth (UEE), it attempted to enact mining restrictions in and around the Aaron Halo. However, because the belt was not specifically included in Stanton II\u2019s purchase contracts, the company was required to relinquish its claim. Crusader Industries has submitted a legal challenge that has yet to be resolved by the UEE courts. In the meantime, the right to apply for mine claims in the belt has been unilaterally granted to all.\n",
    "Lanisto (Tyrol 1a)": "Lanisto (Tyrol 1a) is the moon of Tyrol I, the closest planet to the two stars of the unclaimed Tyrol system.

The moon's largest settlement, Front Row, is partially situated within the remains of an ancient, extinct volcano.\n",
    "Abeni Okon": "Abeni Okon (2157 - 2252) was the first Human born on a planet other than Earth (Sol III). Her parents, Kinah and Madu Okon, were early colonists of Mars (Sol IV), the first planet successfully terraformed by Humans. Okon was lauded in the media as a symbol of human ingenuity and perseverance, partially due to the failure of the first Mars terraforming project in 2125. Though her parents made an effort to keep her safe from the spotlight, she was hounded by media orgs and parasocial strangers. In her late teens she embraced her fame, making appearances at any party and bar willing to pay her fee, engaging in frivolous spending, and making ill-advised investments. The media that once lauded her began to predict her downfall. However, in her late 20s, she withdrew from the public sphere without explanation and started working in community outreach programs. She moved often, and always to areas that needed help. Her final public appearance was in 2232, as the guest of honor at the launching of the colony ship Artemis. She died of natural causes in 2252 and is buried on Mars. Her birthday, 18 March, is celebrated as a Human holiday, particularly on Mars.\n",

    "Leir I": "Leir I is a small, naturally habitable planet in the Leir system. Rich in minerals, it was initially settled by independent miners, mostly Humans, who established settlements without government support from the United Empire of Earth (UEE). It was not officially developed by the UEE when it was discovered in 2677 thanks to Imperator Illyana Messer VI's disinterest in the planet's resources. When a dangerous cult took over neighboring planet Mya (Leir II) in 2812, the UEE government chose to allow the Leir system and all its planets to remain unclaimed. Leir I remains autonomous, and is home to a scattered collection of small towns and mining outposts.\n",
    "Adaliz Dayan": "Adaliz Dayan (2279 - 2317?) was a Human terraforming engineer who is credited with the discovery of the Banshee system. While working for the group terraforming Hyperion (Fora III) in the Fora system, she formed the Immram Association, an organization devoted to exploring the region between terraforming tasks. Dayan disappeared under unusual circumstances while investigating a pocket of radiation. During the search for her ship, it was discovered that the pocket of radiation marked a jump point to the Banshee system. While it is believed she likely jumped there, she has never been located. The system was named Banshee in her honor, inspired by the nickname she earned playing college sataball.\n",
    "Leir III": "Leir III is the final planet from the sun of the Leir system. A carbon planet, Leir III's surface is a sandy desert partially covered in towering graphite crystals. Its atmosphere of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, sulfur, nitrogen, and ozone gives rise to powerful storms. Soon after its discovery, adventurous colonists attempted to erect permanent installations that would endure the weather, but their efforts were forced to cease when indigenous valakkars, the megafauna also known as giant sandworms, repeatedly destroyed the half-finished buildings. Today, a handful of miners and outlaws live on Leir III in temporary encampments around the planet that can be easily moved ahead of deadly storms or valakkar attacks.\n",
    "Adam Corr": "Adam Corr (2519-????), United Planets of Earth Army veteran (Sergeant, honorably discharged), participated in the Battle of Idris IV (2544) and served under Ivar Messer I. He was later implicated to be one of the two people who allegedly perpetrated a series of bombings of the United Planets of Earth by order of Messer in 2546. Corr, an infiltration specialist, bailed demolitions expert and possible accomplice Cyrus Ishitaka out of prison in Cestulus (Davien II) days before the first bombings struck the city. His whereabouts after this incident remain unknown.\n",
    "Leir System": "The Leir system is an unclaimed planetary system made up of a type-A main sequence star and three terrestrial planets. Discovered in 2677 by a team of ICC Stellar Surveyors, initial assessments showed that the system was rich in minerals. However, the newly-ascended Imperator Illyana Messer VI chose not to commit United Empire of Earth (UEE) resources to its development in favor of strengthening her position. Independent miners soon established themselves on the naturally habitable Leir I. In 2743, the terraforming rights to Leir II were sold to Hatfield & Harding. Although the terraformation was completed, project leader Dr. Marcus Fayel led a takeover of the planet in 2812, backed by a base of followers now known as the Outsiders. Today, a small community of miners on Leir I are happy to trade with any visitors, but the people of Leir II refuse to purchase goods made in the UEE in order to maintain a \"pure\" society.\n",
    "Adir (Pyro 5c)": "Adir is the third moon from the gas giant Pyro V, Pyro system. Jagged mountains and rocky hills dominate its crater-ridden landscape.

    "Leonard Casse": "Leonard Casse (2563 - 2615) was a notable spacecraft designer and engineer and founder of Casse Aerospace known for his influence on J. Harris Arnold, Silas Koerner, Jules Parleigh, and other aerospace luminaries. In 2587, he was hired as a junior engineer at Roberts Space Industries (RSI) and was assigned to the Starbright transport team, where he was promoted after identifying a potentially dangerous flaw in its design. By 2595, he had been named lead designer of the 2600 Starbright, which was praised for its entry system and internal flight controls upon its release. In 2599 he left RSI, citing dissatisfaction with the hierarchical structure, and founded his own company, Casse Aerospace, which operated on a flat organizational model in which everyone's opinions would have equal weight. He was only able to create two ships, the Cosmo Sloop and the Hurricane fighter, before perishing in a mid-air collision in 2615. His work rose to fame again in the 2780s, when J. Harris Arnold of Anvil Aerospace began to feature Casse's signature flourishes in his own designs. In 2902, he was inducted into the Edleson Design Institute Hall of Fame.\n",
    "Advocacy": "The Advocacy is an inter-system police force formed in 2523, serving the United Empire of Earth (UEE).

While local systems and planets do have their own police and security, the Advocacy supersedes their authority and its agents are authorized to exercise more power in pursuit of crimes across systems.\n",
    "Levski": "Levski is a permanent, independent settlement located on Delamar in the Nyx system. Built out of the remains of an abandoned QV Planet Services mining facility, it was founded in SEY 2655 by a group of Human political dissenters called the People\u2019s Alliance and named after a 19th century Earth revolutionary. Refugees from Messer Era (2546 - 2792) Earth (Sol III) were welcomed as early residents to this fledgling egalitarian community, along with fugitives escaping unjust government persecution. Pirates, smugglers, and other outlaws have been known to frequent Levski as well, in spite of opposition from the People\u2019s Alliance.\n",
    "Aegis Dynamics": "Aegis Dynamics is a Human spacecraft manufacturer based on Cestulus (Davien II). Because it manufactured a majority of the military ships used by the United Empire of Earth (UEE) during the Messer Era (2546 - 2792), the company became synonymous with the fascist regime of the time. After the fall of the Messers in 2792, Aegis Dynamics faced massive public backlash; losing its military contracts, suffering massive layoffs and internal restructuring. Relegated to producing parts, the company avoided bankruptcy when civilian sales jumped on the redesigned Retaliator bomber. Today, the company is a major manufacturer of both civilian and military crafts.\n",
    "Leyland's Tortoise": "Leyland\u2019s tortoise is a species of tortoise indigenous to Earth (Sol III). They have glossy shells with minor color variation around the scutes and the edges of the shells. Extremely docile, they are kept as pets by Humans, especially long-haul spacers. Over-collection and habitat destruction have made them nearly extinct in the wild.\nLeyland\u2019s tortoises have smooth, domed shells in shades of green, yellow, and brown. The shell is relatively smooth; even if the tortoise matured in harsh conditions, the shell shows little to no scute pyramiding. The edges of the shell flare out slightly at the sides. The plastron is usually yellow, with green edging where it connects to the shell. The back end of the plastron is indented in a V-shape, underneath which is a small, nubby tail. Each of the tortoise\u2019s four legs ends with five claws.\nThe original habitat of Leyland\u2019s tortoise was limited to the South American continent, along the Andes mountains and into the central rainforest. Due to habitat destruction, the only remaining wild breeding population of Leyland\u2019s tortoise on Earth is found along the Amazon river in protected areas of rainforest. Attempts to establish Leyland\u2019s tortoise on other planets have been met with limited success; Saisei (Centauri III) and Locke (Idris IV) both sustain minor Leyland\u2019s tortoise populations. In 2875, conservationists attempted to introduce the tortoise to Lo (Corel III). However, Banu residents of the planet consumed it at an unsustainable rate. The population did not take hold.\nThe tortoises are foragers, most active in the late afternoon until sunset, with a smaller window of high activity from sunrise to midmorning. Seeds, greens, fruit, invertebrates, roots, grasses, and fungi form the bulk of the tortoise\u2019s diet. Over 50% of its day is spent at rest in shared burrows with other tortoises. After consuming a large meal, a tortoise might rest, totally immobile, for up to a week at a time.\nLeyland\u2019s tortoises are popular pets due to their docility, low-cost diet, long lifespan, and adaptability to varying conditions. They are easily kept aboard most spacecraft in roofless enclosures 2 meters wide, 2 meters long, and 50 centimeters high. Plenty of shady spots and heated areas should be provided along with shelter and water. Ideally, a tortoise should not be kept alone. It is recommended that owners choose companions of the same sex to discourage unintentional breeding.\nBecause the tortoise is nearly extinct in the wild, it is illegal to own one that has been captured instead of captively bred. Any person within the UEE found with a wild-caught Leyland\u2019s tortoise in their possession is subject to fine and arrest.\n",
    "Aemelia (Kiel 3a)": "Aemelia (Kiel 3a) is the moon of Severus (Kiel III), United Empire of Earth (UEE). Before the anti-Messer revolution in 2792, the UEE Army utilized its wide icy plains as training grounds for land warfare. There are many long, straight scars left by tank treads across Aemelia's landscape that are still visible from the surface of Severus.\n",
    "LH307 Genesis": "The LH307 Genesis is a medium-range passenger spacecraft developed by Crusader Industries. Major space transport services such as Meridian Transit utilize the Genesis in their fleets as a way to standardize repair processes and lower maintenance costs.

Passenger and freight transport are the most common configurations of the Genesis, followed by military adaptations such as troop transports and Space Warning and Control System (SWACS) setups.\n",
    "Aero (Terra I)": "Aero is a mesoplanet in the Terra system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Orbiting closest to the system's sun, its surface is too dangerous for any Humans to venture upon for any great lengths of time under the limits of current technology. Many attempts have been made by corporations and private individuals to establish profitable mining operations on Aero, but none have succeeded.\n",
    "Li'tova": "Li'tova is the central code of ethics and main religion for the Xi'an people. It was established in roughly SEY 33900 BCE by early Xi'an. The core of Li'tova centers around the concept of time; specifically, the intent and effect of all actions throughout time, no matter how small. It was codified into Xi'an law in MXY I.0 (19668 BCE) by Emperor Ya.l'\u0113 se Ru'a, the only surviving daughter of her House and the first Xi'an Emperor. A dedicated commune to Li'tova is located on the planet R.aip'u\u0101ng (Kai'pua III).\n",
    "Aeroview": "Aeroview is a spacecraft hangar manufacturer, presently a wholly-owned subsidiary of Shubin Interstellar. Founded by Arthur Nassir early in 2687, the company first made a name for itself by designing custom hangars for wealthy clients.

Pilots who train in the flight academies on M.iiy'ong (Ail'ka IV) engage in extensive war-games in the belt. Spacecraft manufacturer Aopoa utilizes the asteroids as obstacle courses to test the agility of their ships.\n",
    "Life/Labor-Style Employee Contract": "The Life/Labor-style employee contract is a controversial legal agreement that gives a corporation a high degree of control over employees in exchange for housing, medical support, and the provision of other social services. It was developed in the early 26th century by Arial Hurston and continues to be a major aspect of the Hurston Dynamics workforce today. Since its introduction, workers' rights groups have continually protested its use, stating that the contracts are intentionally structured to entrap employees into lifelong service with little avenues to complete or negate the contract.\n",
    "Ail'ka Belt Beta (Huichuaihyao sy.en'o se Ail'ka)": "The Ail'ka belt beta is the second asteroid belt from the sun of the Ail'ka system. Rich in valuable minerals, it is the system's largest mine, ensuring that all military projects, no matter how large, do not need to rely on imports to obtain raw materials. Rather than stripping resources from the belt as fast as possible, the military only excavates what is actively needed for production.\n",
    "Lightning Bolt Company": "Lightning Bolt Company is a Human manufacturer of spacecraft energy weapons. It was founded in the early 2921 by Irina Arkadova, who worked as a private military contractor before starting the company. Arkadova first became interested in weapon design after becoming increasingly frustrated with her weapon\u2019s performance in the field, a construction fault that she attributed to lack of practical field testing and experience. Their first manufactured weapon, the Mayak range of hardened electron cannons, proved a success among security professionals and allowed the company to begin producing specialized personal weapons as well.\n",
    "Ail'ka System": "The Ail'ka system is an inhabited planetary system within the Xi'an Empire (SaoXy'an). Reported by the Xi'an to have been discovered in 2538, its existence was kept secret from the United Empire of Earth (UEE) during the Xi'an-Human Cold War (2530 - 2793), and only declassified in 2793. Humans were not allowed to enter the system until 2915, upon special invitation from military spacecraft manufacturer Aopoa.\n",
    "Linton Messer XI": "Linton Messer XI (2745-2792) was the last of the Messers to occupy the office of Imperator in the United Empire of Earth (UEE). He assumed control of the UEE in 2781 after seizing power from his father, Ulysses Messer X. During his reign, he sold the terraforming rights of Garron II to a private company with connections to his family, knowing that the planet was inhabited by sentient beings. Revolutionary group Tide leaked footage of the resulting carnage to the media, sparking the Anti-Messer Revolution. During the uprising, Linton was killed in office.\n",
    "Akari-Kr.\u0113 Treaty": "The Akari-Kr.\u0113 Treaty is a ratified agreement between Terra (Terra III) and the Xi'an Empire (SaoXy'an) that brought about the unofficial end of the Xi'an-Human Cold War (SEY 2530 - 2793 / MXY III.838 - III.1044). It was brokered in SEY 2789 (MXY III.1040) by the Senator of Terra, Terrence Akari, and Xi'an Emperor Kr.\u0113. Due to the political instability of the late Messer Era (SEY 2546 - 2792), negotiations for this treaty were conducted in secret on the Tohil system on undeveloped world Tohil III. The holiday Armistice Day, created in celebration of the war's end, is held annually in the UEE on 29 May.\nIn the latter years of the Messer Era, the UEE and the Xi'an Empire had been on the brink of war for over two centuries, and public sentiment on both sides was strongly in favor of ending the conflict. Planetary systems that bordered the two empires were kept under constant military surveillance, draining funding that was desperately needed in other areas. Major Houses within the Xi'an Empire had lodged protests against sending their youth to face uncertain fates against a hostile enemy, and, with the threat of Vanduul attacks becoming a large concern, Humans began to doubt the Messer regime's continued use of the Xi'an as the cause of all the UEE's problems. Additionally, Linton Messer XI was an unpopular ruler. He had left his father's brutal policies in place instead of undoing them as he had promised his supporters before his SEY 2781 coup, and his habit of swift and deadly retaliation had lost him most of his allies in the Senate and the military. Conditions were ripe for the opening of a road to peace.\nSenator Terrance Akari of Terra and Emperor T.u\u0113ng se Kr.\u0113 of the Xi'an Empire first began exchanging communications in SEY 2775 (MXY III.1032). The Senator had long held an interest in Xi'an culture, and utilized his political status to pull strings and pass questions along to the Xi'an government when he came up against a cultural concept he didn't understand. To his surprise, the Emperor himself began responding to his missives. Kr.\u0113 recognized the opportunity for what it was: a chance to cultivate a connection to the second highest echelon of Human government. As their correspondence increased over the years, they began to discuss what peace might look like between the UEE and the Xi'an Empire.\nIn SEY 2789 (MXY III.1040), they agreed it was time to meet in person and discuss the creation of a possible treaty. After weeks of deliberation on the subject, they chose the Tohil system as the location due to its lack of military presence and position on the border of both empires. While Emperor Kr.\u0113 made his way there with the aid of his government, Akari had to escape the notice of his or risk being arrested and thrown into an Empire's Light Conversion Center for collaborating with an alien power. He enlisted the help of Terra's Advocacy Section Chief Nathan Warrick, who put Akari into contact with a group of smugglers that regularly transported anti-Messer activists between Bremen and Tohil through the unclaimed Nyx system. It was a risky undertaking; Akari was in constant danger of being apprehended by pro-Messer forces, and Emperor Kr.\u0113 was inviting war with the UEE by entering into Tohil in the first place. Their mutual safe arrival on Tohil III created a buoyant mood that Akari identified as a motivating factor in their work on what would become the Akari-Kr.\u0113 Treaty.\nOn 11 March, the peace accord was completed, and Emperor Kr.\u0113 signed it on behalf of the Xi'an Empire. He departed for the Xi'an capital planet Ka'ua (Hyoton IV) soon after, where he would secure the approval of the Imperial House's Council of Three. Akari made his way to Earth (Sol III) and spread word about the treaty's existence amongst his most trusted staff members and fellow pro-peace Senators. On 29 May, while Linton Messer XI and his sister Fiona were on vacation in the Goss system, Akari triggered an emergency session of the Senate and called for an immediate vote on the treaty. Without the Imperator there to rally any opposition, the deal was narrowly approved.\n1 - Non-aggression agreement: The Xi'an Empire and the UEE agreed to not threaten or use force against one another's territory or independence, and to acknowledge one another's right to self-defense if subject to armed attack.\n2 - Border Security: Each side promised to respect one another's territory and to not cross their respective borders without permission.\n3 - The Perry Line: The Xi'an Empire and the UEE agreed to withdraw their military forces from the Perry Line. Political refugees. The Xi'an Empire agreed that they would accept Human refugees from the UEE, and Terra agreed to provide resources to aid in their care.\n4 - Status of Terra: If leadership in the UEE rejected the terms of the treaty, the peace agreement would stand between Terra and the Xi'an Empire.\n5 - Duration of terms: The terms of the agreement were to remain in place indefinitely unless any terms were broken or in the event of a change in structure of the UEE or Xi'an governments.\nHistorians credit Linton Messer XI's refusal to ratify the Akari-Kr.\u0113 Treaty as the moment the Messers fully lost their grip on the UEE. Although the Imperator declined to sign the accord when it arrived at his desk, the Xi'an Empire withdrew its military forces from the Perry Line as promised, demonstrating the hollowness of the Messer regime's assertion that they were the only thing standing between the people and a Xi'an invasion. This, coupled with the regime's inability to arrest Akari, who had gone into hiding, fueled public perception of Linton Messer XI as an incompetent ruler. People who had previously felt that standing against the Imperator would be too risky took the plunge and joined up, swelling the ranks of the anti-Messer movement. This influx of funding and connections would later enable the resistance group Tide to obtain footage of the Massacre of Garron II and finally end the Messer dictatorship. On 5 July SEY 2793 (III.1044.08), the Perry Line Pact was ratified and signed by the new UEE government and the Xi'an Empire, officially bringing an end to the cold war.\n",
    "Liston Garrity": "Liston Garrity (2248-2317) was a weapons designer who founded weapons design house and manufacturer Garrity Arms in the late 23rd century.

    "Livia Messer III": "Livia Messer III (2593-2661) was Imperator of the United Empire of Earth (UEE) from 2628 to 2643. She inherited the office from her father, Deacon Messer II, when he voluntarily stepped down. Livia expanded her father's legal reform efforts by increasing the maximum sentences for convicted criminals and restructuring the definition of prisons, allowing her to build political prisons on Charon III. She also increased government oversight of media, effectively establishing an unofficial office of propaganda, and restricted travel in the interest of security. She, her husband Daniel Scota, and her son Marius were victims of a shuttle crash in 2641, when their craft malfunctioned upon atmospheric re-entry above Moscow, Earth (Sol III). Though she survived, the rest of her family did not. She retired in 2643, after giving her son the honorary title Marius IV. She died in her sleep in 2661; one month before Deacon II.\n",

Vara's engine work on the M50 earned him his first Aron Award in 2921. He was promoted to chief engineer in 2925, a position he held until he left to found his own company in 2932. A few years after his departure, a design sketch depicting an open-canopy racer was discovered in Origin's archives. Vara collaborated with Origin to bring this concept to life, and the X1 racer debuted in 2947.\n",
    "Amandeep Vakario": "Amandeep Vakario (2884 - present) is a self-proclaimed spirituality leader, motivational speaker, and self-help coach. He is best known for his 2942 book Enlightened Negotiating and for his individual work with high-profile clients. Born on Terra (Terra III), he attended a series of meditation seminars in 2903, where he experienced a \"spiritual revelation\" while laying in a sensory deprivation tank. This experience led him to self-publish his first book, Finding the Hidden You, which saw enough success that Vakario began a self-produced Spectrum-based spiritual advice show. Costless Visualization amassed a large following, eventually enough to land a guest spot on the show Something Every Tuesday in 2936. After this, his popularity skyrocketed, and he retired from his show in favor of taking on individual celebrity clients such as Ellroy Cass and Magnus Tobin. At Tobin's request, Amandeep wrote and performed the inspirational quote series Moments of Clarity, which are played in the Commons of New Babbage, microTech (Stanton IV).\n",
    "Lo (Corel III)": "Lo (Corel III) is the largest populated planet in the Corel system, United Empire of Earth (UEE), and is represented by one Senator. As a major population center on the border between the UEE and the Banu Protectorate, it is a hub of trade and commerce between the two civilizations and is home to both Humans and Banu. The largest shipping and customs center, New Junction, is located in one of Lo's hottest regions. Meticulous inspection of goods that pass through the planet combined with frequent dust storms often cause long backups in traffic, sometimes requiring haulers to stay overnight.\n",

Founded in the early 2500s, the company has held a longstanding contract with the United Empire of Earth (UEE) to provide handheld and shipboard weapons to the military. Though it supplied many of the weapons utilized by government forces during the Messer Era (SEY 2546 - 2792), A&R's continuous charity work for veterans and their families has helped keep the company's reputation neutral after the fall of the Messers.\n",
    "Locke (Idris IV)": "Locke (Idris IV) is the sole inhabited planet in the Idris system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Terraformed and colonized by Humans in the early 26th century, it was captured by the Tevarin in 2542 during the First Tevarin War (2541 - 2546), and used as a main strike hub for the Tevarin fleet while it was under their control. It became the site of the Battle of Idris IV in 2544, a key engagement that turned the tide of the war in favor of the United Planets of Earth (UPE) and launched Ivar Messer's political career. Much of the landscape that was destroyed via orbital bombardment has since been rebuilt, though some craters remain. A thriving tourism industry is based in the city of Tanys, located in the Corsti Mountains. Additionally, the planet is famous for the quality of its brandy and cognac.\n",

    "Anthony Tanaka Remembrance Day": "Anthony Tanaka Remembrance Day is a holiday in the United Empire of Earth (UEE), observed annually on December Third. It is held in honor of Anthony Tanaka, a child laborer who was publicly executed by an Advocacy agent on 3 December 2757 for refusing to obey an order to continue working. Footage of his murder was captured and smuggled out of the factory by members of the anti-Messer movement, where it became a symbol of resistance against the cruelty of the Messer government. In 2793, after the events of the Anti-Messer Revolution, ImperatorErin Toi signed a declaration from the Senate that recognized the anniversary of Tanaka's death as a holiday. Traditionally, observers light candles in honor of Tanaka while they observe a moment of silence.\n",
    "Luminalia": "Luminalia is a holiday celebrated by both Banu and Humans annually on December 22nd. It originated as the irregularly-held Banu festival tsikti efanga (Glow Festival), marked by the lighting of ceremonial lamps that stay lit until their fuel is consumed (about 34,000 beats / 2 Standard Earth Days). While the lamps are burning, all Banu, no matter where they are, are considered one Souli. They invite friends, business associates, and passing strangers into their Soulis and give them gifts so they will always have something to sell. All attendees are expected to provide food, drinks, and/or party favors in return, and if they can't, the host will often have those items available for sale.\nHumans in the Davien system began to participate in the festival with Banu shortly after the Banu-Human Interstellar Peace and Trade Accord in 2438, when a ship repair Souli on Cestulus (Davien II) lit their lamps and invited Humans to come and celebrate with them. It spread from system to system as Humans in commercial workshops or trading ships used the festival to boost sales. Private events for family, friends, and extended families inspired by these profitable galas became common enough that the United Empire of Earth (UEE) officially recognized Luminalia as a holiday in the 2557. Banu began to light their lamps at the same time as Humans as a symbol of friendship and a way to enjoy an increase in business. As the holiday grew in popularity, Human merchants modified the traditional gift sharing by hiding empty gift-wrapped packages that could be returned unopened in exchange for a surprise like a few credits or a small toy. The increased foot traffic into their stores increased holiday sales and became a tradition in its own right. Today, Banu and Humans commemorate Luminalia with gift-exchanges, present hunts, glowing lights, gatherings of family, friends, business associates, and acquaintances, food and drink, limited-time discounts, and decorations in green and red.\n",
    "Anti-Messer Revolution": "The Anti-Messer Revolution was a complex series of events spanning decades that culminated in the end of the fascist Messer regime, the death of Linton Messer XI, and the disappearance of Fiona Messer in SEY 2792. The Akari-Kr.\u0113 Treaty, which signaled the upcoming end of the Xi\u2019an-Human Cold War (2530 - 2793), played a significant role in sparking dissent against the Messer government. The Massacre of Garron II, broadcast over the Spectrum by the activist group Tide, fanned that dissent into a flame and open revolts against the Messers began. After twenty-two days of civil unrest, the Messers were removed from power, and Imperator Erin Toi took office.\n",
    "Lunes": "The lunes fruit, known also as the \"spiral fruit\" due to the circular ridges that form on it as it approaches ripeness, is an edible fruit indigenous to Osha (Kilian VI). Before Osha was terraformed, the lunes tree was one of the wild plants selected to be re-introduced to the planet after terraformation was complete. Humans who settled on Osha bred subsequent generations of the tree to bear the soft, sweet, and juicy lunes fruit. Lunes fruit are popularly used in ice cream and other desserts.\n",
    "Lynx": "The Lynx is a luxury exploration vehicle developed by Roberts Space Industries (RSI). The company adapted the Lynx from their existing Ursa rover to include alongside their Constellation Phoenix luxury model spacecraft. The Lynx drops some of the Ursa's armor and internal modularity in exchange for luxury fittings and general quality of life improvements.\n",
    "Anti-Ship Mines": "Anti-ship mines, also called proximity mines, are explosives that can be placed at fixed points in space. They are designed to explode when spacecraft come within a particular range, inflicting heat and projectile damage on anything nearby. Mines are used by the military for purposes of area denial and are often abandoned if unused during a conflict, making former battlefields dangerous to traverse. Anti-ship mines were used extensively in former Perry Line systems during the Xi'an-Human Cold War (SEY 2530 - 2793). Many were abandoned, and remain active and dangerous in spite of cleanup efforts.\n",
    "Antimatter Processing Plant": "An antimatter processing plant or refinery is a factory constructed to purify and convert antimatter precursors into usable antimatter. Antimatter precursors are mined from a variety of sources and shipped to refineries for processing. The processed antimatter is used for starship drives and antimatter warheads. The process can be extremely dangerous for workers. Hurston in the Stanton System and the penal planet Quarterdeck are home to a significant number of antimatter processing plants.\n",
    "Lyre": "Lyre is a major city on Cassel (Goss II), United Empire of Earth (UEE) that became a tourism center after Cassel was declared a natural wonder in 2624.

In the 2800s, restoration work began in Lyre when the inhabitants of the Goss system pooled their resources to revitalize Cassel. Its crystalline buildings, erected during the city's boom years, are among its most popular attractions.\n",
    "Antimatter Warhead": "Antimatter warheads are high yield explosive weapons armed with an antimatter payload rather than fission or fusion devices. Because they are among the most destructive weapons available to the United Empire of Earth's (UEE) armed forces, their deployment and availability are closely monitored by the UEE government. Hurston Dynamics, headquartered on Hurston (Stanton I), is one of their main manufacturers.\n",
    "Lyria (Stanton 3a)": "Lyria is a natural satellite of ArcCorp (Stanton III) that orbits more closely to the planet than its sister moon, Wala (Stanton 3b).

    "Antoine Lebec": "Antoine Lebec (2258 - 2307?) was a navjumper most notable for his discovery of the Nul system in 2290. Born on Earth (Sol III), he was inspired to become an explorer after Nick Croshaw discovered the Croshaw system in 2271. He completed pilot training in 2277, but wasn't able to afford his own spacecraft until 2282, when he won a land and mineral rights lottery to a plot on Angeli (Croshaw II) that sat on a natural vein of copper. This source of revenue enabled him to purchase a ship and become a full time navjumper. When he discovered the Nul jump point, he reported that he had found \u201cnul\u201d during his initial visit there, thus giving the system its name. He disappeared while investigating the outskirts of Nul in 2307. Historians speculate that he may have perished while attempting to navigate the Nul-Caliban jump point that would later be discovered by Ashleigh Gonn.\n",

RSI also produces an Apollo Medivac variant with additional armor and missile racks for protection in combat.\n",
    "Magda (Stanton 1c)": "Magda is the third-closest moon to Hurston (Stanton I). Although its temperature falls into ranges friendly to life, its nitrogen-methane atmosphere cannot be safely breathed. Enormous areas of blue-green dirt on Magda's surface are said to resemble oceans when the moon is viewed from orbit. The moon is named after former Hurston Dynamics CEO Magda Hurston, who recommended that the company purchase Stanton I from the United Empire of Earth (UEE) in 2865. In recent years, natural geological formation Sketto Rock has become a popular location for landscape photography.\n",
    "Magda Hurston": "Magda Hurston (2833 - 2921) was the CEO of Hurston Dynamics from 2883 to 2915. It was her initiative that led the company to purchase Stanton I from the United Empire of Earth (UEE) in 2865. The third moon of Hurston is named in her honor. She was succeeded as CEO by her son, Gavin E. Hurston.\nThe oldest child of Chesterfield Hurston and Mariah Park Hurston, Magda was born in 2833 on Rytif (Bremen II) at a hospital near the site of Hurston Dynamics' secondary headquarters. She received her early education on Earth (Sol III) and attended the Haymore School of Economics in Geneva for her undergraduate and graduate degrees, where she attained a Master of Science in Organizational and Social Psychology. Her dissertation, Live, Work, and Play: Employee Productivity in Controlled Environments, was selected as one of the winners of the Best Dissertation Prize for the 2854/2855 academic year. After a year-long internship at the University of Persei Analytical Research and Quantification (UPARQ) on Persei (Rhetor II), she joined the family business in 2856, starting as an Associate Operations Analyst.\nMagda moved upward through the ranks despite several clashes with distant relatives in higher positions, eventually becoming Chief Operations Officer in 2863. During this period, she made multiple cost-saving operational changes to Hurston Dynamics, such as utilizing nutritional supplements instead of fresh ingredients to reduce the cost of employee meals and opting for in-house production of worker protective equipment in place of renewing expensive outsourcing contracts. In 2865, she spearheaded her largest project: the purchase of governing interest and settlement rights for the naturally habitable planet Stanton I and its four moons from the UEE. It was under her advice that then-CEO Chesterfield Hurston agreed to the unprecedented expense. The changes they could make to the weapon manufacturing process, out from under the strict laws of the UEE, would save the company trillions. Chesterfield approved, and the planet Hurston was officially established.\nWhile Hurston Dynamics' mining division broke ground on antimatter precursor mines on the surface of Hurston, Magda supervised the design and construction of the first residential buildings that would later form the heart of the Workers District. She took a brief break in 2867 after the birth of her son Gavin. When Hurston's first antimatter refinery plant was completed in 2872 and workers began to arrive, the need for a much larger settlement became apparent. Magda spent five years identifying areas to cut costs so that new construction could be built quickly and at low price. The city of Lorville was officially founded in 2877.\nIn 2883, halfway through the erection of Central Tower, Hurston Dynamics' new headquarters, Chesterfield died after a short battle with pancreatic cancer. Magda succeeded him as CEO. Under her leadership, daily work hours were extended for those under the Life/Labor contract, and a weekly task-completion competition to shorten workday minutes was introduced. These changes improved overall efficiency by 3%. She oversaw the completion of Central in 2890, as well as a wide expansion of the company's antimatter mining, processing, and weapons construction. The contract she signed to provide the UEE military with antimatter warheads netted record profits. She continued her father's strip-mining operations, exempt from the UEE's anti-pollution laws thanks to the planet's independent status, allowing speedy and cheap extraction of Hurston's natural resources.\nShe retired as CEO in 2915 and was succeeded by her son Gavin, though she stayed on the board of Hurston Dynamics in an advisory capacity.\nWhile en route from the Hurston Central building to Teasa Spaceport, where she was planning to travel via a private service to her family's vacation home on Cassel (Goss II), her shuttle suffered a mid-flight collision with another shuttle. She and six other people died in the crash.\n",
    "ArcCorp (Company)": "ArcCorp is a Human business conglomerate that oversees a diverse set of industries, including manufacturing, mining, terraforming, and space exploration. Founded in 2687 as a deep-space exploration consortium, ArcCorp shifted to mining in the early 2700s and fusion engine manufacture in the 2810s. Their fusion engine is the standard engine for 100+ meter spacecraft. After purchasing Stanton III from the United Empire of Earth (UEE) in 2865, ArcCorp developed the planet to support business and property interests. By utilizing Xi'an urban development theory, the planet became the most industrialized planet in the UEE.\n",
    "Magma (Kilian IV)": "Magma (Kilian IV) is a highly geologically active planet in the Kilian system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Rich in rare minerals, Magma is the most active mining area in Kilian in spite of the frequent earthquakes. Lakes of lava often form and drain in the aftermath of volcanic eruptions and other tectonic activity, making the construction of permanent installations very difficult.\n",
    "ArcCorp (Stanton III)": "ArcCorp is the third planet from the sun of the Stanton system, and is one of four planets in the United Empire of Earth (UEE) owned by a corporation. When the megacorporation ArcCorp purchased the world in 2865, leadership chose to partition off the land and lease it to other organizations and individuals for further development instead of conducting all work solo. ArcCorp is the most populous planet in the Stanton system. Its largest port, Area18, is the planet's main hub for commercial activity and interplanetary traffic.\n",
    "Magnus I": "Magnus I is a chthonian planet in the Magnus system that orbits closest to the sun. Rich with high-value minerals and gemstones, the United Empire of Earth (UEE) maintains exclusive mining rights to the planet, dating from when its main shipyards were located on Borea (Magnus II). Borea's Senators have repeatedly petitioned the UEE to return mining rights to the people of Magnus, but the UEE has thus far refused to capitulate.\n",
    "Archangel Station": "Archangel Station is a Human space station in the Chronos system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). It was initially constructed by the UEE in the 29th century as the marshalling and scientific nerve center for Project Archangel, also known as Synthworld. Shipping traffic through Archangel Station has varied radically as support for the project has waxed and waned. The platform remains the home port of the 18th Battle Group.\n",
    "Magnus III": "Magnus III is a super-Jupiter gas giant in the Magnus system, and is the planet furthest from the system's sun. Authorities in the system discourage travelers from visiting the planet due to documented pirate activity in the area.\n",
    "Area18": "Area18 is the main commercial port of ArcCorp (Stanton III) and serves as a nexus for traffic in the region surrounding the planet. Riker Memorial Spaceport, the main spaceport on ArcCorp, is located in Area18, and is connected to the Central Plaza via the Cityflight Transit shuttle service. As one of the zones on ArcCorp cleared for interplanetary commerce, Area18 is heavily trafficked by offworld traders and visitors. Privately-owned security firm BlacJac Security, first hired to keep the peace on the company\u2019s behalf in 2906, have recently been criticized by local news media for excessive use of force.\n",
    "Magnus System": "The Magnus system is a planetary system in the United Empire of Earth (UEE). It was discovered in 2499, and subsequently selected as the headquarters of the UEE Navy (UEEN). Once the center of a thriving industry centered around the UEEN\u2019s shipbuilding facilities, the system\u2019s economy crashed when the Navy moved their operations to Kilian in 2631. Though the system has entered a period of revitalization thanks to Drake Interplanetary establishing their headquarters and prime production facilities on Borea, its population is low compared to similarly aged systems in the UEE. It is made up of a chthonian planet, a terrestrial planet, a gas giant, and a K-type star.\nIn 2499, the Magnus system was discovered as a part of Project Far Star. Initial surveys of the system showed it to be uncommonly empty of asteroid fields, protoplanets, or other potential hazards for space travel. Only one of its three planets was identified as a good candidate for terraforming. The system\u2019s then-remote location and abundance of natural resources found in the planet closest to the sun attracted the attention of the then-United Planets of Earth Navy (UPEN), who were in search of a new center for shipbuilding. After procuring funding from the Senate in 2533, the UPEN began a military-run, closed-terraforming operation on Magnus II.\nThe system\u2019s star, Magnus, is an orange-red K-Type main sequence star that is roughly 5 billion years old. Magnus I, a mineral-rich chthonian planet, orbits closest to the sun. The UEE Navy maintains exclusive mining rights to it, dating from the early 26th century. The super-Jupiter Magnus III, noted for its multi-chromatic bands of gas, orbits the furthest from the sun. Borea (Magnus II), a rocky terrestrial planet, is the only habitable planet in the system. Residents of Borea sometimes claim to outsiders that a fourth planet called \"Triggerfish\" orbits beyond Magnus III. It does not. This led to the creation of the eponymous popular holiday.\nBorea (Magnus II)\nBorea is a temperate planet that was identified as a prime terraforming candidate when the system was discovered. It was held up as a landmark example of terraforming success, with many climates closely resembling those of Earth. A century of unfettered shipbuilding, however, polluted the atmosphere, essentially rolling back some of the changes previously made by terraforming and transforming the climate to the harsh one it is known for today.\nThose who did not follow the Navy when it left for Kilian took up residence in Borea\u2019s abandoned properties and started up businesses in cheap ship repair and bootleg components fueled by harvested scrap. The system developed a reputation as a place where people who wanted to escape their past could reinvent themselves, no questions asked.\nThe empty warehouses and monolithic industrial equipment deemed too expensive to transport by the UEEN are no longer being left to deteriorate. Drake Interplanetary purchased much of them from the UEE in 2845 for very low cost, opting to open factories and set up their headquarters in Odyssa on Borea instead of more cosmopolitan systems like Terra. Job opportunities are increasing, and once-disreputable ghost towns are being repaired as more and more people choose to migrate to Magnus. The system\u2019s economy is slowly on the mend.\n",
    "Magnus Tobin": "Magnus Tobin (2756 - 2912) is the founder of microTech and the architect behind the company\u2019s purchase of Stanton IV from the United Empire of Earth (UEE). Upon receiving his Equivalency, he entered his parents\u2019 textile company and helped it generate record profits when he overhauled its technical structure. In 2782, Tobin accepted startup funds from his parents to officially incorporate microTech. The company struggled to turn a profit until he partnered with former mentor Aleena Tressler, whose advice led him to hire notable engineers and developers and grant them autonomy over their own projects in the interest of fostering the next great idea. His purchase of the company Empiric Education led directly to Tobin\u2019s creation of the first mobiGlas. Its success ultimately made microTech one of the largest companies in the UEE. Tobin died in 2912, after personally overseeing the construction of New Babbage.\n",
    "Aremis (Vega II)": "Aremis is a terrestrial planet in the Vega system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Famous for its set of rings, the planet is sharply defined by two shepherd moons that orbit it on the inner and outer sides. After being minimally terraformed, it was initially settled only by the Human military to house Army, Navy, and Marine bases. Its population expanded when refugees from its neighboring system fled the Fall of Virgil in 2737 and settled. Since then, the population steadily rose and Vega II was on track for planetary recognition. After the planet was attacked by the Vanduul during the Battle of Vega II, it was recognized by the UEE Senate on 10 November 2945.\nToday, while it is still not fully recovered from the attack, Aremis has both a strong military presence and a growing population of native-born civilians and descendants of refugees. The city of New Corvo has developed into a center for commerce and experimental cuisine.\n",

Educated at University of Persei Analytical Research and Quantification (UPARQ), Fayel was hired by Hatfield & Harding in 2743 to oversee the terraformation of Leir II. Soon after arriving on the planet, Fayel established his own mining operation without the knowledge of his employers but was otherwise considered a model overseer. In 2803, Hatfield & Harding named Fayel \"Employee of the Year,\" but he declined to receive the award in person. Instead, he sent a vid to the banquet in which he constantly repeated the phrase \"purity of purpose.\" Finally, in 2812, Fayel cut all communication from Leir II and sent out a looped broadcast announcing that the planet's \"purification\" was complete and that he and his followers would be its stewards. Hatfield & Harding dispatched mercenaries to retake the planet, but were rebuffed. Fayel renamed the planet Mya and led his religious order until his death from natural causes in 2816.\n",

Born on Gonn (Oberon I) in 2504, she was the oldest of seven children, and was often left in charge of caring for her siblings while her parents worked in the mines or gambled after work. She ran away from home at age 14, disappearing from public record until her reappearance in 2528 when she disclosed the discovery of the Horus system to the United Planets of Earth (UPE) government. The extensive planetary charts she provided with this report have led historians to believe that Sante first visited Horus up to a decade earlier, but Sante refused to provide any further information. Her 2542 discovery of a jump point to the Xi'an-controlled R.il'a system prompted the UPE to add Horus to the Perry Line and close it to non-military personnel. Sante refused to leave. She continued to explore Horus, evading and occasionally clashing with the Navy as they tried to push her out of the system. In 2545, she and her ship vanished without a trace. Sante's ultimate fate remains unsolved, and is a popular subject of stories and documentaries on Serling (Horus I).\n",
    "Arial Hurston": "Arial Hurston (2466-2537) was the third CEO of Hurston Dynamics. During his time as CEO, his cost-cutting measures pushed Hurston Dynamics into two decades of record profits.

The UEE\u2019s propaganda machine under the Messers responded by working to discredit Kieren, and his referendum failed. The ensuing controversy ended Kieren's political career. He disappeared the following November.\n",
    "Associated Science & Development": "Associated Science & Development (ASD) is a high-end Human spacecraft weapons manufacturer headquartered on Persei (Rhetor II).

    "Astrid Messer VII": "Astrid Messer VII (2661-2701) was one of two Imperators of the United Empire of Earth (UEE) from 2697-2701. She seized power from her aunt Illyana Messer VI after the latter died of a sudden stroke. Agents loyal to Illyana smuggled her youngest son and named successor, Samuel, away from Earth (Sol III) before Astrid could have him assassinated. As Imperator, Astrid devoted military resources to locating Samuel, expanded censorship, and ordered mass arrests of journalists who spoke against the conflict. She was assassinated by Samuel\u2019s agents in 2701, which led to his ascension to Imperator.\n",
    "Asura (Ferron III)": "Asura is the third planet from the sun in the Ferron system in the United Empire of Earth (UEE). Terraformed shortly after the system's discovery in 2460, the early settlers of Asura generated a great deal of wealth from the planet's rich mineral deposits. Asura became one of the richest planets in the UEE, with a thriving economy immediately evident by the grand, ornate architectural style common in its cities. However, in the early 29th century, its mineral resources were fully depleted, and within a decade, the economy was in shambles. Though the population has fallen considerably since the mining crash, it is still represented by two Senators.\n",
    "Atchivo": "Atchivo is a settlement on Goss I, United Empire of Earth (UEE), located deep within the planet's largest agricultural zone.

    "Atlas Platform": "The Atlas Platform was a mobile missile platform developed by Anvil Aerospace for the United Empire of Earth (UEE) military. First introduced in 2808 as the first in a potential line of anti-air and anti-space vehicles to be used in ground-based engagements. Its sturdy frame and adaptable chassis proved successful in combat, and Anvil accepted a long-term contract with the UEE to develop military vehicles. After it was retired in 2821, the frame of the Atlas was used as the basis for the Ballista missile platform in 2822, and again for the Spartan armored personnel carrier in 2951.\n",
    "Atrocity at Jata": "The atrocity at Jata was the first in a series of bombings that took place in the United Planets of Earth (UPE) in 2546. While only the initial attacks took place in Jata, Cestulus (Davien II), the name became synonymous with bombings that were shown to have used the same technology on other worlds. After multiple attacks and almost five thousand civilian deaths with no perpetrator identified by the Advocacy, then-High General Ivar Messer used the attacks to stoke public fervor to support the creation of the office of Prime Citizen, to which he was shortly elected. The architect of the bombings was never conclusively found. Evidence uncovered in 2806 by historian Sydney Kamarck posits that Messer himself may have arranged the bombings with two former acquaintances from the UPE Army.\n",
    "Atuvo": "Atuvo is a Human manufacturer and retailer of upscale kitchenware, houseware, appliances, and furniture headquartered on Mars (Sol IV), United Empire of Earth (UEE). Founded in 2872 by noted chef Chu Th\u1ee5y Du, it started as a small shop in Port Renatus. It soon gained a reputation for producing quality goods, enough so that after a year of major profits in 2881, Atuvo expanded to three other locations. The success of its Foodspace System, a series of kitchen technologies designed to save space while serving all possible food preparation needs, caught the attention of Roberts Space Industries (RSI), who partnered with Atuvo to supply their Constellation Phoenix with tables, chairs, and appliances.\n",
    "Aurora CL": "The Aurora Clipper (CL) is a light freighter variant of the Aurora series of single-crew spacecraft developed by Roberts Space Industries (RSI).

Platforms that have fallen into disrepair are sometimes abandoned.\n",
    "Avenger": "The Avenger is a multi-role fighter sold by Aegis Dynamics. It was initially designed as a United Empire of Earth (UEE) carrier-borne spacecraft in the late 28th century. As more focused interceptors and space superiority spacecraft were developed in the mid-29th century, the Avenger found a second life as a law-enforcement utility spacecraft until it too was replaced by more current designs. Today, the ship is flown by civilian pilots thanks to ease of use, reliability, and Aegis releasing multiple variants. Avenger variants include the Titan cargo ship, Stalker bounty hunter and Warlock EMP platform.\n",
    "Emil Quast": "Emil Quast (b.2888 - present) is an architect and interior designer notable for his work on the Flowhouse, a public assembly building on Terra (Terra III) with an organic, curving silhouette. Self-taught, he began his career in Jele City, Vann (Croshaw III), where he made waves for his use of wood accents on the walls of his close friend Jiemba Kahlon\u2019s art gallery. Jele City's governor hired him to redesign her office, the first in a series of public works that eventually led him to relocate to Prime, Terra. Roberts Space Industries (RSI) hired Quast to help design the interior of the Constellation Phoenix, which debuted to high acclaim in 2944.\n",
    "Aydo": "Aydo is a major city on Green (Ellis III) in the United Empire of Earth (UEE). A coastal city, it sits atop a sheer wall of cliffs overlooking the ocean. In the past, gaps in these cliffs were used as tracks in one of the legs of the race that ultimately gave birth to the first Murray Cup. While most of these gaps have since been closed off, some of them have been preserved and can be closely viewed during MCR Museum tours. Murray Tower, a 5-star hotel and restaurant located in Aydo, boasts a spectacular view of the city, the cliffs, and the ocean, and is often booked years in advance. Aydo's population is said to double during the Murray Cup.\n",

It is the duty of the Emperor to make decisions that affect all Xi\u2019an while adhering to the tenets of Li\u2019tova and Xi\u2019an law while considering the advice of the Council of Three. The Emperor also acts as the head of the Imperial Bureaucracy (P\u014d\u2019t.\u014dngp.\u016b) and ceremonially \u201cadopts\u201d all Service members into the Imperial House until their Service has ended, symbolizing the unity of the Xi\u2019an people for the collective good. An inherited position, the Emperorship is passed down from mother to daughter in the regnant Xi\u2019an House, or, in uncommon cases, from mother to son. While male Xi\u2019an can become Emperor in their own right, they cannot pass on the position to their descendants. Upon the death or abdication of a male Emperor (Tao\u2019yusao) who has no female relatives, another House is chosen by the Council of Three to take his and his Line\u2019s place, and a new Imperial Age begins.\n",

    "Mars Tragedy Memorial": "The Mars Tragedy Memorial is a monument located near Port Renatus, Mars (Sol IV) that was constructed to honor the memory of the 4,876 people who died in the Mars terraforming disaster of September 13, 2125. It was dedicated in a ceremony by Senator Stephen Nguyen in 2157, who had lost a sibling to the tragedy.\n",
    "Emperor Bloom": "The Emperor Bloom is a member of the genus Plena, of the Tuserac family of plants. It is one of many varieties of flowering plants indigenous to Terra (Terra III) with a solitary flower featuring a conical spiral of petals over the pistil. Its vibrant color, strong scent, and long blooming season have earned it a prominent place in Terran culture.\nFound primarily in the tropical regions of Terra, the Emperor Bloom Reserve in the state of Vastac attracts thousands of sightseers every year.\nThe mature plant features a single, thick stem with simple, basal, elliptical leaves. When the plant begins preparing to flower, it develops a dark brown husk coated in brown fuzz that averages 15 cm in length. One by one, the Emperor Bloom drops its leaves as its energy is redirected into incubating the blossom. Finally, the husk turns a deep purple and unfurls into a spectacular, three-tiered flower in showy shades of violet.\nIt blooms during the temperate dry season, when average temperatures reach 25 C. The outer petals of the flower drop off when temperatures begin to average above 32 C. The conical spiral of petals in the center harden and darken as the plant develops its seeds. At the height of the dry season, the pods burst open and hundreds of fluffy seeds are picked up by the late-dry winds and propagated to germinate at the beginning of the wet season.\nIn 2559, a group of early planetary surveyors came across a field of these flowers on the outskirts of what would later become Prime. Specimens were collected and brought back to the settlement, where they were cultivated over centuries to maximize flower size, scent, and brightness of color. Today\u2019s domestic Emperor Bloom is larger in size than its wild cousins and has a longer flowering time.\nThe Emperor Bloom has become an unofficial symbol for Terra\u2019s natural beauty. It\u2019s celebrated on Terra with the Twilight Festival, which is held every year in Vastac at the start of blooming season. The morning of the festival, ships both airborne and aquatic cross the Zaffre Bay from Prime to reach the vast Emperor Bloom reserve. Temporary viewing areas are made available to attendees so they can enjoy the flowers without accidentally trampling them. Food, music, and games are featured at the festival, along with an outdoor market where attendees can purchase their own Emperor Blooms. Just after sunset, the elected chairman of the festival simultaneously illuminates hundreds of lights that have been staked among the flowers.\n",
    "Marshall Leon": "Marshall Leon (2753-2891) was a Human politician who served as Imperator of the United Empire of Earth from 2801 to 2811. Leon started his career in social services in 2774 and worked up to the Governors Council of Reisse (Rhetor III). From there, he was elected as Senator where he served from 2787 to 2793, and then as Diplomatic Secretary of the UEE under Imperator Erin Toi from 2793 to 2800. He conceived of the Ark during his time as Diplomatic Secretary, obtaining approval for its construction from the Senate in 2794. During his campaign for Imperator, he was endorsed by Toi on the strength of his diplomatic achievements and his work on the Ark. He attended the opening ceremony for the Ark during his first year in office. When Leon finished his term as Imperator, he joined the Ark\u2019s Board of Directors, a position he held until his death.\n",
    "Rhetor I": "Rhetor I is a mesoplanet in the Rhetor system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Because it lacks an atmosphere, there is an extreme difference between its day and night temperatures. Despite its extreme daytime heat, there are patches of water ice on Rhetor I, generally located on the floors of deep craters around the north pole.\n",
    "B3": "B3 is a strong brandy distilled in the Rhetor system from blue bilva, a fruit indigenous to Reisse Rhetor III). In 2733, a group of students at the University of Mentor on Mentor (Rhetor IV) used a bushel of blue bilva as the basis for an experimental homemade spirit. The concoction, which retained a sweet flavor profile along with a powerful alcoholic punch, was a hit at their next party. Blue bilva brandy continued as a student-made spirit enjoyed by locals until 2872, when the drink was smuggled to the University of Rhetor on Reisse and it underwent a surge in popularity. Following this increase in demand, three University of Mentor students started the Blue Bilva Brandy company in 2875, with B3 as their flagship beverage.\n",
    "Emperor Se'ang se Ru'a": "Tao'yusao Se'ang se Ru'a was the final Emperor of the Xi'an Empire (SaoXy'an) belonging to the Imperial Line Ru'a, the ruling House of the First Imperial Age (MXY I.0 - I.14680 / SEY 19668 - 878 BCE). He was the only son of his mother Tao'nuasao Ch.ul'\u0113 se Ru'a, who died at an unexpectedly young age without further issue, leaving Se'ang the only Ru'a qualified to inherit the crown. Faced with an unprecedented situation, Se'ang worked together with Ru'a's Council of Three to devise a method to choose the next Imperial House. Ultimately, the method they devised selected House Xy.\u014d as the successor to the throne, and Se'ang voluntarily stepped down to allow Y.ah'a se Xy.\u014d to ascend as the first Emperor of the Second Imperial Age (MXY II.0 - II.1824 / SEY 878 BCE - SEY 1457 CE).

    "Empire's Light Conversion Centers": "The Empire\u2019s Light Conversion Centers of the Charon system were a large network of prisons constructed on Charon III by the Messers, starting with ImperatorLivia Messer III. These maximum-security facilities were reputed to be the most secure in the United Empire of Earth (UEE) and were used to house political dissidents opposed to the Messer regime. Following the fall of the Messers in 2792, the Governors Council of Charon III ordered that the prisons be torn down and published evidence of previously unproven atrocities committed against the prisoners by the former government. In the subsequent public uproar, Charon III voted to renounce its UEE recognition.\nShortly after Livia Messer III ascended to Imperator in 2628, she presented a proposal to the Senate to build a special maximum-security prison under the sole jurisdiction of the Imperator in the sparsely populated state of Dellin on Charon III. The project would kickstart the struggling economy with new jobs and an influx of government funds. The Senate granted near-unanimous approval.\nThe first prison, completed in 2630, injected enough money into the economy that the population of Charon III sharply rose. By the time Imperator Corsen Messer V ascended in 2643, the once-rural colony in Dellin had become an urbanized center of commerce based around Livia\u2019s prison. Corsen ordered the construction of more facilities in Dellin and its neighboring state Acheron after a meeting with the Governors Council of Charon III in 2644. The largest of these, Orville, became the central processing center for all new prisoners. The collective of facilities was named the Empire\u2019s Light Conversion Centers (ELCC). During this time, Charon III\u2019s economy boomed. In 2670, Corsen sent a decree to the Senate ordering the recognition of Charon III. A former Representative of Dellin, Gwen Czukay, was sworn in as the planet\u2019s first Senator and the world was officially recognized under its new name, Haros.\nThe largest group of prisoners were political dissidents. These included deserters from the military, Xi\u2019an sympathizers, former members of the press, protestors, social organizers, violent agitators, and even politicians. Anyone who acted or spoke against the edicts of the Messer government was in danger of being imprisoned on Haros. Convictions weren\u2019t necessary; being arrested for a political crime was enough to put someone in Orville, ostensibly to await a fair trial. Many died there, waiting for hearings that were never granted. Contact was not allowed with the outside world.\nPrisoners were put to work producing components for the UEE military or low-cost goods to be used by public welfare programs. Their meals were bland but nutritionally complete, and medical care was available to those who took ill so that they could continue to work until they died of old age or exhaustion. When Astrid Messer VII ascended to Imperator in 2697, standards of living in the ELCCs, already poor, plummeted. Funds meant for prisoner welfare were redirected to military resources. Malnutrition, dehydration, exhaustion, and disease became the leading causes of death.\nUnder Samuel Messer VIII, who ousted Astrid from power in 2701, a new decree set interment limits so that old-age prisoners would be killed to make room for new ones. The dead were interred in mass graves in the Dellin desert.\nRumors about the deplorable conditions in the ELCCs began to spread among the people of Haros, though no hard evidence could be found. Any workers suspected of leaking information were themselves at risk of imprisonment and all civilian protesters were incarcerated or killed, eventually quelling any kind of organized protest against the prisons. In 2751, the military began testing bioweapons on segments of Orville\u2019s populace. Bodies buried in the desert leached chemicals and radiation into the already poor soil, fueling a new collective action among the populace of Haros. Though any dissent was brutally suppressed, protests increased in frequency for the following few decades.\nWhen news of Imperator Linton Messer XI\u2019s death in 2792 reached the populace of Haros, they stormed the prisons, liberating those inside. They arrested or killed any guards who hadn\u2019t fled and broke into offices previously sealed off to the public, recovering centuries of documentation on acts of torture, murder, and other atrocities conducted by those who ran and guarded the prisons. First-hand accounts from the formerly incarcerated were compiled and sent to media organizations across the UEE. Senator Constance Whittlefield of Haros was arrested on charges of fraud. In 2795, the planet voted to renounce their recognition of the UEE and revert to their former designation of Charon III.\nEven after the Messers were permanently ousted from power and a new, progressive government reformed under Imperator Erin Toi, Charon III refused to rejoin the UEE, citing their forced participation in crimes against Humanity as reason enough to permanently remain independent. The government then razed the prisons to the ground. Anti-UEE sentiment, common on Charon III, continues to be especially strong in Dellin.\n",
    "Rijora": "Rijora is a set of guidelines and principles concerning the behavior and lifestyle of the Tevarin people. Written by many authors over a long period of time, it was created in response to early Tevarin perishing repeatedly at the hands of predators on their homeworld Kaleeth (now Jalan, Elysium IV). It emphasizes an active existence and requires responsibility to oneself and one's community. Followers are required to develop and consistently maintain physical and mental skills, especially as pertains to warfare. Before the end of the Second Tevarin War (SEY 2603 - 2610) all Tevarin were required to memorize the Rijora and could recite it on command. Rijora was renounced by many Tevarin after the war due to its failure to uphold its promise to deliver victory. During the events of the Tevarin Purge, parts of Rijora were lost when the authoritative codex that recorded it in its entirety was destroyed; namely, passages that had been revised or redacted from print but had been documented for historic purposes. Rijora has seen a resurgence in popularity in recent years thanks to an ongoing movement to revive Tevarin culture.\n",

    "Rijoran Temple": "The Rijoran Temple on Jalan (Elysium IV) is one of the few remaining religious buildings constructed by the Tevarin that was not destroyed during their cultural Purge after the Second Tevarin War(2603-2610). Rijora was a doctrine that emphasized active existence and responsibility to the self and others. Followers were required to develop and consistently maintain physical and mental skills, especially as pertained to warfare. The temples, including the final standing one on Jalan, were built without seating in order to provide wide spaces open to all followers of Rijora to train. During the Purge, Tevarin made several attempts to destroy this temple, but Human militias were able to protect it. Today, it is one of the most popular tourist attractions on Jalan.\n",
    "Entertainment Nine Transmission (ENT)": "Entertainment Nine Transmission (ENT) is a Spectrum broadcast network that focuses on live and scripted entertainment programming intended to appeal to Humans between the ages of 18 and 34.

    "Roberts Space Industries (RSI)": "Roberts Space Industries (RSI), founded in the early 21st century, is one of the oldest and most influential space technology companies in the United Empire of Earth (UEE). Spacecraft, spacecraft components, and terraforming technology make up the bulk of their products. In 2075, RSI created the quantum core engine, and in 2113, the company released the earliest terraforming machinery utilized by Humans. RSI entered a period of decline during the Messer Era (2546 - 2792), when their military contracts were terminated in favor of Aegis Dynamics, and further shrank 2757, when Ulysses Messer X publicly blamed the company for the death of Anthony Tanaka. It wasn't until the end of the Messer Era that RSI's military contracts were reinstated. Today, their Bengal line of carrier ships and Pegasus line of escort carriers are utilized by the United Empire of Earth Navy (UEEN).\n",
    "Massacre of Garron II": "In 2792, ImperatorLinton Messer XI sold off the terraforming rights of Garron II to the Bright Worlds Terraforming Group (BWTG). One of the indigenous species, which had shown sentience and was known to both the BWTG and Linton Messer, was exterminated during the terraforming process. An anti-Messer revolutionary group called Tide obtained footage documenting the atrocity and released it over Spectrum, interrupting broadcasts galaxy-wide. The vids sparked an outrage among the long-oppressed population of the United Empire of Earth (UEE). Subsequent riots and military action led to the end of the 246 year Messer dynasty.\n",
    "ROOK Heavy Metals": "ROOK Heavy Metals is a Human manufacturer of combat armor and personal protection gear. Their products have a good reputation for defense, but the heavier models are generally less maneuverable than other manufacturers' alternatives. Though not intentionally designed for intimidation, the large and boxy profile of the armor strikes a memorable silhouette on the battlefield.\n",
    "Equivalency": "An Equivalency is a certification awarded to people in the United Empire of Earth (UEE) upon completion of their secondary education. It can be earned through the completion of an upper or full secondary UEE-certified education program or through passing a group of subject tests issued by the UEE government. All civilians in the UEE must earn their Equivalency in order to pursue post-secondary education, enter the armed services, or earn full Citizenship.\nAs outlined by the Common Laws, all people born in the UEE have the right to an education. Between ages 13 to 14, the majority of students in the UEE begin their secondary education at public schools overseen by teachers employed by a planet's Governors Council. Classroom size and teaching style vary from planet to planet, but all students are required to complete a standardized exam that has been standardized according to UEE educational requirements. Most students are awarded their Equivalency between ages 17 and 18.\nPeople in the UEE who don't have access to planet or colony-provided secondary education are able to complete their secondary education programs through the same educational programs that are provided to public school students via Glas or computer system. Rural students often complete their education through Spectrum-guided learning programs. Without a teacher to set the pace, provide lectures, or to address questions, self-guided students are free to achieve Equivalency whenever they have completed their program.\nPrivate and military academies also offer courses in secondary education. The teacher- to- student ratio in these academies is generally smaller than that of public schools, and the education is more personalized. However, these courses are not government provided. All students must pay tuition, either out of pocket or through grants and scholarships.\nDuring the Human Colonial Expansion Era (2380 - 2530), secondary education was required by law for all children born within the United Nations of Earth (UNE). As more planets were discovered and colonized, the law became difficult to enforce. Children born to the first settlers of early colony worlds who could not be sent back to more developed parts of the UNE for their education were homeschooled, if they were schooled at all. To address this gap in education, in 2464 the UNE released a standardized set of computer-based learning modules called the Educational Equivalency Curriculum (EEC). These modules replaced in-person education on worlds where teachers and schools were not yet available. Those who successfully completed the program were awarded an Educational Equivalency Degree (EED), or Equivalency, which certified that the holder had completed all secondary-level education requirements under UNE law.\nThe Equivalency was intended to be a temporary replacement for in-person education until colony worlds established stable local governments. However, as intersystem expansion continued, more and more Humans completed their secondary education via EEC. When the Common Laws were established in 2526, the United Planets of Earth (UPE) designated the EEC as the standardized secondary education curriculum. The provision of a formalized education and offering Equivalency exams became the responsibility of all local governments.\nDuring the Messer Era (2546 - 2792), the EEC was edited multiple times to indoctrinate the populace into pro-Messer ideology. Xenology and sociology modules were increasingly seeded with anti-alien, pro-Human thought. The history module was especially edited; key events in Ivar Messer's rise to power were presented as the plans of aliens seeking to destabilize the government. Events directly perpetrated by the Messers or their agents that could not be blamed on aliens, such as military action against Human-led protests, were not taught at all.\nFollowing the fall of Linton Messer XI in 2792, all EEC modules were recalled by the new government and were completely revised. Secondary school was suspended until a new version of the EEC with a detailed history on the Messer Era was released in 2794.\nThe EEC is updated and revised once every ten years.\n",

He was killed in action in 2551 while performing a high-risk extraction.\n",
    "Ergo (Nemo III)": "Ergo (Nemo III) is an inhabited ocean planet in the Nemo system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Although today there is no indigenous life on the planet, the vast quantities of oil under its oceans suggests that at one point it supported an ecosystem of animals and plants. Paleontologists theorize that a mass extinction event took place roughly 300 million SEY ago. Because of the relative lack of land, the majority of Human settlements on the planet are situated on artificial islands and floating platforms. Oil and tourism are the main industries on Ergo. One of its main attractions is the planet's moon, nicknamed the \"Space Whale\" for its supposed resemblance to a whale, a large aquatic animal native to Earth (Sol III).\n",
    "Rough & Ready": "Rough & Ready is a major criminal organization known for operating refueling stations throughout the Pyro system. Founded by former Headhunters enforcer Rook Garavis in 2939, the gang's early focus was to pull back on active criminal activity and gain enough capital to do more than just survive. They conducted a series of meticulously planned raids on multiple refueling stations, taking them over and establishing themselves as the off-market version of Rest & Relax. By the 2930s, their refueling stations had become a dominant force in Pyro. While they charge high prices, the protection they offer to those using their stations is considered worth the price. Likely in honor of their founder, chess pieces are a prominent part of their symbolism. Their major base of operations, Checkmate Station, is located near Monox (Pyro II).\n",
    "Eri City": "Eri City is the capital of Severus (Kiel III), Kiel system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Once a center of military power during the Xi'an-Human Cold War (SEY 2530 - 2793), the infrastructure abandoned by the armed forces when they left Kiel after tensions cooled are now being utilized by major aerospace corporations such as Roberts Space Industries. Some buildings have been torn down and replaced with city parks, and others have been converted to civilian apartments. One major renovation project was the expansive convention hall built near the city's center that has been home to the Intergalactic Aerospace Expo since 2916. A culture of fine dining developed after Severus was recognized in 2937, and the city has become a top destination for gourmet food enthusiasts.\n",
    "MaxOx": "MaxOx is a Human manufacturer of personal and spacecraft-mounted weapons. The company was originally formed in the late 28th century to produce medical lasers. Impressed by their laser\u2019s power and precision, United Empire of Earth (UEE) government officials contracted with MaxOx founder Burl Hitchens in 2778 to adapt his work to the then-classified weaponized terraforming project codenamed Vespa. Hitchens clandestinely sabotaged the project in order to keep such a destructive weapon out of government hands. When Vespa failed to materialize results, the government ended Hitchen\u2019s contract and released MaxOx\u2019s medical patents to the public. The company's sales drastically impacted, Hitchens pivoted MaxOx into weapon development. Today, MaxOx produces weapons like the NN-series of Neutron Cannons and the 35mm Dredge ballistic cannon.\n",

    "S-Pop": "S-pop (abbreviation of Saisei Pop) is a form of Human popular music originating on Saisei (Centauri III). Common characteristics of S-pop include the incorporation of relaxing organic-sourced sounds and traditional Saisei instruments. The term can refer either specifically to the popular music of Saisei or to any music functionally derived therefrom.\nThe earliest iteration of traditional Saisei music evolved in the 25th century, when Saisei was first established and built up as a colony world. The form owes a significant amount to the slow, methodical process involved in planning and constructing Saisei colony. While typical colonies grow in fits as interest in particular exports drive commerce and immigration, Seisei was instead built up deliberately according to a long-term plan. Lacking the booms and busts of traditional early colonial development that leave newly settled worlds more closely tied to a home culture, Saisei developed its own disparate takes on a variety of Human art forms.\nDuring the initial settlement period, luxury imports from Earth (Sol III) were extremely limited. As a result, traditional Human instruments were uncommon beyond those carried as part of the first wave's personal preference kits. Colonists turned to local materials to develop their own offshoots. Trees seeded during the early terraforming process produced softer wood than is traditionally used to create stringed instruments. This limitation ultimately gave rise to the Saisei-made softwood guitar, or s-guitar, which produces a mellower, more resonant sound than its Earth-made equivalent.\nSaisei musicians soon began experimenting with natural sounds. By the middle of the 27th century, a typical Saisei arrangement might include several dozen different natural samples, often arrayed so elaborately that their source could not be externally determined.\nFor roughly four hundred years, Saisei traditional music was not widespread beyond the Centauri system. That changed in 2932 when Saisei-based band The Claw appeared on Terra, Show Me the Music!, a popular Spectrum-based showcase for aspiring bands. Instead of performing an original song, The Claw chose to perform a Saisei-styled interpretation of Clover's \"Moonlight,\" then at the height of its popularity. The group used a traditional s-guitar and an array of cultivated aquatic insect sounds to give the song what the series' host termed \"eerie, still movement.\" The performance was accompanied by a holographic light show based in traditional Saisei culture.\nIn under two weeks, The Claw had the number one single on popular music charts of both Earth and Terra (Terra III). Viewers initially curious about the light show and the unusual sounds became interested in the music itself. The Terra Gazette dubbed this style of music S-pop. A brief S-pop craze followed The Claw's larger UEE debut with music producers rushing to sign hitherto unknown acts from Saisei and other performers around the galaxy eager to emulate what they considered an exciting new discovery.\nS-pop ruled Spectrum from November 2932 to December 2934 with dozens of songs taking top positions. Although interest in S-pop has waxed and waned in the ensuing years, the impact of the fad has had permanence.\n",
    "Errol Navis": "Errol Navis (2822 - 2931) was an accountant and amateur explorer best known for his 2861 discovery of the Oso system. Born on Carteyna (Cano II) to two geoengineers, he became an accountant at Shubin Interstellar in 2843 after completing a mathematics degree. Later attributed to a childhood spent in a series of confined, environmentally-controlled bases, Navis described himself as harboring a strong desire to live in a world with open skies and a breathable atmosphere. When Shubin denied his transfer request to Terra (Terra III), Navis purchased a small ship, which he used to take himself and his young daughter Oso on weekend trips to exotic locations. During one of these trips, his scanners picked up an anomaly in the outskirts of the Castra system that turned out to be a jump point to an undiscovered system. He used the reward money from the United Empire of Earth (UEE) government to buy a home on Terra and start a business as an accounting consultant.\n",
    "Meridian Transit": "Meridian Transit is a Human passenger and commercial transportation company based on Crusader (Stanton II).

The United Empire of Earth Navy (UEEN) makes use of Esperia's replica spacecraft for testing and for aggressor training their combat pilots.\n",
    "Messer Era": "The Messer Era (SEY 2546 - 2792) was a Human time period during which the Messer family were the absolute rulers of the United Empire of Earth (UEE). It started with Ivar Messer I in 2546, when he seized power of the United Planets of Earth (UPE) government through a combination of political manipulation and propaganda campaigns to create the position of Prime Citizen in 2546. As the new solitary leader of the UPE, Messer conducted sweeping governmental reforms which transformed the office to that of Imperator, a lifelong, hereditary role, beginning a line of succession with his son Deacon. Though the Messers were popular at first, with each subsequent ruler, their policies became more characterized by draconian enforcement of laws, warmongering, greed, corruption, and abuse of power. The last Messer to hold the position of Imperator, Linton Messer XI, was executed in his bed by revolutionaries during the uprising of 2792.\n",
    "Sabre": "The Sabre is a space superiority fighter sold by Aegis Dynamics.

    "Micah Zahir": "Micah Zahir (2460 - 2577) was an independent resource surveyor and landowner most notable for discovering the Oretani system in 2481. Born on Vann (Croshaw III), Zahir migrated to Asura (Ferron III) in 2480 to work as a mining scan operator. When he was unable to find employment, Zahir signed on as an escort for supply convoys. Zahir picked up a strange signal during one of these supply runs that he logged to investigate at a later time. When he returned alone to the area, he undertook a thorough search and discovered the jump point to the Oretani system. He named it after his favorite ship from the 2464 vid Blast Crater, and used the reward money from the UNE to purchase real estate on Selene (Vega III). At the time of his death in 2577, he was one of the largest landowners in the Vega system.\n",

    "MicroProbe": "The MicroProbe was a scanner and autonomous probe briefly sold on Ergo (Nemo III) in 2407. Advertised as the next generation in advanced resource detection technology, it saw high early sales after a report was shared on Spectrum detailing vast stores of natural resources on Nemo I. However, the report was false, and had been written by the creator of the device, conman Marvin Akai Blitz. Local news program Spectrum News Now: Ergo (SNNE) delivered an expos\u00e9 of the tech that prevented further sales before any dangerous expeditions to Nemo I could be launched. In early 2408, sales of the faulty scanner were halted.\n",
    "Euterpe (Stanton 4c)": "Euterpe is the third and smallest moon of microTech (Stanton IV), named for the ancient Earth (Sol III) muse of music. Largely covered by ice sheets and frozen oceans of water, the landscape of the moon is dotted with pillars of rock formations that researchers theorize are ancient cores of extinct volcanoes. Geological evidence suggests that Euterpe was once temperate.\n",
    "microTech (Company)": "microTech is a manufacturer of a variety of electronics, digital displays, software, and computers, including the mobiGlas wearable computer. Founded on Earth (Sol III) in 2782 by programmer Magnus Tobin, today, it is headquartered in New Babbage on the planet microTech (Stanton IV), which they privately own. The planet's cold temperature is ideal for the company's heat-sensitive computing and manufacturing centers. Widespread use of their products has made it the current largest computer and software developer in the United Empire of Earth (UEE).\n",
    "Saisei (Centauri III)": "Saisei is an inhabited planet in the Centauri system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Its buildings and urban development were designed to exist in harmony with the natural landscape. The environmental laws of Saisei prohibit excessive population growth and tightly control allowable levels of pollution from local businesses. Thanks to Saisei\u2019s carefully preserved environment and organic architecture, tourism is one of the planet\u2019s main industries. Spacecraft manufacturer Musashi Industrial and Starflight Concern (MISC) maintains its headquarters in the capital, Fujin City.\n",
    "microTech (Stanton IV)": "microTech (Stanton IV) is the fourth and farthest planet from the sun in the Stanton system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Located at the outer edge of the system's habitable zone, microTech is mostly ice, with some cold-to-temperate areas of tundra. It was purchased from the UEE by the corporation microTech in the mid-2800s. Its capital, New Babbage, is home to many corporations and startups and is a major center for technological innovation.\nMost of microTech is covered in mountains and ice sheets and subject to strong blizzards and ice storms. There are very few liquid bodies of water. Multiple temperate tundra zones exist in areas associated with deep geothermal activity. Camping expeditions and hikes in these greener biomes are popular vacation activities among microTech\u2019s full-time population. Cold-hardy plants such as evergreens, wildflowers, grasses, and lichen grow there throughout the year.\nThawort, a lichen that grows on microTech and other worlds with arctic climates, is the subject of research for several pharmaceutical startups based in New Babbage. Its antiseptic and antibacterial properties have shown promise in the lab, though the properties are only present in wild-collected specimens. Research to replicate these traits in artificial conditions is ongoing.\nDiscovered in 2851, Stanton IV is a super-Earth, and one of four planets in the Stanton system's habitable zone. Full development of the system would have taken funds not readily available to the government at the time. After beginning initial terraforming, the UEE announced the decision in 2865 to sell it and its sibling planets to private interests in order to help pay down its debts and provide a boost to the downturned economy.\nAn early terraforming error resulted in a climate far colder and harsher than initial projections had indicated, leading to multiple debates on the UEE Senate floor regarding the government's ability to sell Stanton IV. However, it was thanks to this error that founder and then-CEO of microTech Magnus Tobin purchased it as the new headquarters for microTech. Tobin sold off land his company had been using for server farms in the leadup to this acquisition. According to a contemporary press release, the \"reliably frigid\" climate of Stanton IV was ideal for keeping their expansive network of servers cool. Tobin personally oversaw the construction of New Babbage, the largest city and now-headquarters of microTech at large.\nPlanetary governance is conducted by specialized divisions of the microTech corporation. Population-sustaining departments such as water infrastructure and waste management exist alongside economic ones such as taxation, business licensing, and import/export. Former elected officials or government workers are typically hired for these roles, though those from the private-sector are not barred from selection. Upon their purchase of the planet, microTech upgraded their corporate security force to perform police actions where necessary. Wherever possible, microTech utilizes technology and custom microTech-designed systems and software to automate much of the day-to-day operations, including the enforcement of local laws. As immigration to microTech increases, leaders within microTech have debated the implementation of an eventual population cap.\nThe city of New Babbage was designed to support the creativity of the highly-skilled workforce needed to drive microTech's future innovation. Areas like the Commons were constructed as creative workspaces, dedicated to providing areas for programmers and engineers to relax, network, and plan. The city's robust nightlife provides an outlet for the workforce's high-pressure crunch times and higher-than-average salaries, and visiting financiers and venture capitalists make regular use of the high-end bars. Inhabitants also like to escape the confines of the city to take part in outdoor cold weather activities.\nBleeding-edge technology is a common sight on microTech. Not only due to the company itself, but also the presence of other established tech companies alongside a constantly-cycling roster of startups. Residents who don't keep abreast of the latest advances are generally seen as gauche by their peers, though this outlook varies. Members of the upper-classes of the UEE frequent the markets to secure the newest tech before it officially debuts.\n",
    "Everline Structures Incorporated": "Everline Structures Incorporated is a Humans manufacturer of Housing Exchange (HEX) stations, affordable housing with commercial spaces that are built into hollowed-out asteroids. Although the company offers an extended contract to perform maintenance on their products for ten Standard Earth Years, most businesses and individuals that purchase HEXes opt out of the extra cost and abandon the stations when they become too expensive to repair. Stations that have been discarded by their owners are common throughout the United Empire of Earth (UEE), especially in areas once used for mining purposes. Abandoned HEX stations are often repurposed as by squatters housing or utilized as bases for those who wish to conduct business outside of United Empire of Earth (UEE) law.\n",
    "Everus Harbor": "Everus Harbor is a space station that orbits the planet Hurston (Stanton I) above the city of Lorville. Owned and operated by Hurston Dynamics, it is the primary port of call for all large-scale incoming and outgoing cargo from Lorville. Private traders are known to buy and sell commodities on Everus Harbor.\n",
    "Midas Fish": "The Midas fish is an aquatic animal indigenous to the planet Cassel (Goss II) in the Goss system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Prized by aquarium enthusiasts for its golden color morph, the Midas fish is a protected species on its home world, and is sometimes poached. A breeding program to replenish their numbers, overseen by Cassel's Governors Council, has been underway since SEY 2936.\nMidas fish vary from large to small, and have one dorsal fin, four triangle-shaped pectoral, and ventral fins, and an indented tail fin. All Midas fish are protandrous or born male. When they reach around seven Standard Earth Years of age, larger males will change sex, becoming female.\nColoration is widely varied, with most wild Midas fish being mixed gray and white with black-tipped tail fins and a gold streak at the corner of both eyes. Pink, orange, white, and black specimens have also been observed. The highly sought gold color morph, characterized by shimmering yellow scales streaked with white, exists in nature in small frequencies. Its prevalence in the hobbyist trade is a product of many generations of selective breeding.\nUsually, Midas fish live in small groups among the warm ocean reefs of Cassel, consisting of one large female and a mature male, along with a few non-breeding immature males. If the female dies, then her reproduction partner will change sex and one of the other males in the group will mature and become her mate. They are herbivorous, and spend most of their time grazing on seagrass, or using their powerful jaws to crush and ingest pieces of algae-coated coral. The polyps along with any coral particulates pass harmlessly through their digestive systems.\nWhen it is time to breed, the female will lay eggs in a sheltered area and the breeding male will fertilize them. As the eggs mature over a period of about one week, the group of fish will take turns guarding them from potential predators until they hatch. The fry will disperse after another week of being guarded. They breed yearly, early in their local warm season.\nMidas fish are endangered on Cassel. This is partially due to the development of resorts near their habitats, but largely due to over-hunting to supply the pet trade. The capture and trade of wild Midas fish was banned on Cassel in SEY 2927, and in the UEE at large in 2934. Thanks to this ban and Cassel's Golden Touch repopulation project, the Midas fish's numbers have been steadily rising and are expected to reach a non-threatened level in the late 2960s. Captive bred Midas fish remain legal to own and trade.\n",
    "Midnight Calathea": "The midnight calathea is a plant created by Rayari Inc to survive in extremely low light conditions. As opposed to the green of most plants commonly found on the Human homeworld Earth (Sol III), the midnight calathea's leaves run from deep purple to dark red, and are embossed with blue veins. Its dark color and the altered chlorophyll structure allow the plant to absorb light from the entire visible spectrum.\n",

Built with Void armor, low-draw weapons, and low-emissions drives, the Hornet Ghost is the stealth fighter of the civilianized Hornet lineup. It trades some offensive capacity for the technology to diminish its signature from standard sensors, but can still be used as a dogfighter. Ghosts are utilized by mercenaries charged with strike operations and by data runners who will need to fight if identified.\n",
    "Min 1a": "Min 1a is the closest moon to the rogue planet Min I in the unclaimed Min system. Due to the forces of tidal heating, Min 1a is intensely geologically active, with a network of volcanoes that produce plumes of sulfur that can climb hundreds of kilometers above its surface. Lava flows from the near constant eruptions paint the moon's surface yellow, with subtle streaks of green, white, red, orange, and black. Min 1a sustains a thin atmosphere composed mainly of sulfur dioxide.\n",
    "F8A Lightning": "The F8A Lightning is a next-generation, single-seat, triple-thruster space superiority heavy fighter developed for the United Empire of Earth Navy (UEEN) by Anvil Aerospace. Built as a successor to the F7A Hornet currently utilized by the UEE military, the F8 was specifically designed as a match for the latest Vanduul fighters. It is more maneuverable and heavily armed than its predecessor. Use of the Lightning is restricted to elite UEEN squadrons, though it is expected to see widespread adoption over the next decade.\n",
    "Badger Bad": "Badger Bad is a Human weapons and ammunition manufacturer specializing in missiles and handheld rockets. It was founded in 2932 by former employees of Talon Weapon Systems who were seeking to break their former employer\u2019s hold on the missile market. Though they have yet to completely disrupt Talon\u2019s sales, Badger Bad\u2019s missiles have seen high sales numbers in the civilian market.\n",
    "Baker I": "Baker I is the first planet from the binary stars in the Baker system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Due to its proximity to the suns, its surface has been eroded to the point that its iron core is partially exposed. Astrophysicists estimate that it will collide with one of the system's stars in approximately 150 million years.\n",
    "F8C Lightning": "The F8C Lightning is a civilian variation of the F8A Lightning space superiority fighter developed by Anvil Aerospace. It closely mimics the military specs of the original F8A, and has been used in lines of defense against Vanduul invaders. It was made available in extremely limited numbers to the civilian market by Anvil to celebrate the debut of the F8A in the United Empire of Earth Navy.\n",
    "Fair Chance Act": "The Fair Chance Act is a United Empire of Earth (UEE) law passed by the Senate in 2795, in the wake of the Massacre of Garron II (2792). Sponsored by ImperatorErin Toi, it created a new status for planetary systems, Developing system, and added several protections to said systems in order to foster the development of potentially new civilizations. One or more planets in a given system must harbor sentient or potentially sentient life in order to be declared Developing. Contact with the system's inhabitants, terraforming, and mining are prohibited in order to shield the inhabitants from any interference under the assumption that once they grow to the point of space travel, they can be officially contacted.\n",
    "Min 1b": "Min 1b is the second moon from the rogue planet Min I in the unclaimed Min system. Unique among known celestial bodies, Min 1b supports life in spite of a total lack of sunlight. The same tidal heating that makes Min 1a violently volcanically active causes geothermal activity on Min 1b, giving it enough internal heat to sustain a liquid water ocean. Additionally, its thick hydrogen atmosphere provides enough of a barrier to prevent too much warmth from escaping, allowing the surface of the ocean to be free from ice in many places. Min 1b is home to countless colonies of bioluminescent bacteria that cluster around hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean, along with some bioluminescent plants. A community formed by researchers interested in studying Min 1b's environment, survivalists, and outlaws drawn to the system's unclaimed status formed in 2816.\n",
    "Sakura Sun": "Sakura Sun is a Human manufacturing conglomerate headquartered in Tokyo, Earth (Sol III) that produces a diverse range of consumer products such as home goods, children's toys, and starship engines. Spacecraft components are developed under the Sakura Sun Space Sciences Division (S4D). In 2922, Sakura Sun released the multi-particle wave cannon, a spacecraft weapon developed through research of Xi'an technology. In 2943, they debuted their first power plant, the Light Blossom, designed for low-emission travel.\n",
    "Fairo (Pyro 5d)": "Fairo is the fourth moon from the gas giant Pyro V, Pyro system. A hotbed of seismic activity, Fairo experiences frequent earthquakes that disturb its deep oceans of brackish water. The moon has an unusual ecosystem that thrives both on the surface and under the sea, supported by the carbon dioxide and nitrogen in Fairo's dense atmosphere\n",
    "Min 1c": "Min 1c is the third moon from the rogue planet Min I in the unclaimed Min system. The smallest of the four moons, it has a thin atmosphere of nitrogen and carbon dioxide, and is composed of rocky material and water ices. Like its neighbors, Min 1c experiences tidal heating, though at a low enough level that its tectonic activity is relatively infrequent. In the past, it once had many active volcanoes, enough to possibly have supported an atmosphere that allowed the existence of liquid water. There is a sprawling cavern network beneath its surface.\n",
    "Samuel Messer VIII": "Samuel Messer VIII (2678-2715) was Imperator of the United Empire of Earth (UEE) from 2697 to 2715, though some historians date his rule from 2701. He had officially been named successor by his mother Illyana VI, but his cousin Astrid seized power upon her death and ousted Samuel from power. After a four year civil war, agents of Samuel orchestrated Astrid VII\u2019s assassination, and Samuel officially took the office of Imperator. He tightened restrictions on free speech during his rule and ordered multiple military suppressions of civilian protests. He was succeeded by his older brother Galor Meser IX in 2715.\n",
    "Fall of Caliban": "On 7 July 2884, a Vanduul Clan led by a Kingship launched a surprise attack on the moderately-populated planet Crion (Caliban II). The 88th UEE Navy Logistic Support Squadron were the only military forces in system at the time of the attack. They managed to hold off the Vanduul for two days, allowing much of the planet's population to escape at the cost of nearly the entire squadron. Naval reinforcements arrived on the third day to engage the full Vanduul fleet, but they were unable to hold out against the onslaught. On 23 July 2884, after heavy casualties, Crion and the rest of the Caliban system were lost to the Vanduul. In honor of their sacrifice, the 88th Squadron was retired, earning them the nickname \"the Lost Squad.\" This battle marked the last time a Kingship was spotted by United Empire of Earth (UEE) forces until the Battle of Vega II in 2945.\nSmall Vanduul raiding parties first began attacking Caliban in 2739, during the latter years of the Messer era (2546 - 2792). While the initial raid sparked fear in the system's inhabitants, causing a brief population drain, the skirmishes were largely casualty-free. As raids continued to occur at a steady rate of between two and five per year, the UEE installed a small naval presence along with system-wide perimeter sensors. The people of Crion saw this response as inadequate; political activism spiked among the populace, but the Messers sent no more aid.\nDuring the fall of the Messer regime in 2792, the military presence in Caliban was pulled away from the system to repress mass civilian uprisings elsewhere. A medium-sized Vanduul Clan launched a raid on the largely undefended system, which claimed over one hundred lives. The newly formed post-Messer UEE government ordered the 31st Battle Group to Caliban to fend off the invasion. Their efforts were successful in stopping the raid from spiraling into something much deadlier.\nSubsequent Vanduul raids dropped down to previously established levels of roughly five per year, finally peaking in 2859 when a single large Clan clashed with the 31st Battle Group in the system's asteroid belt. This was the last Vanduul raid until 2884. By 2870, the 88th Logistics Support Squadron was Caliban's only protection.\nAt 04:43 Earth Standard time (UST), 7 July 2884, a Vanduul Clan led by a Kingship slipped past the system-wide sensor beacons. Two pilots of the 88th, on patrol near Caliban IV, spotted the Clan. Both of them fired off a distress signal, but their messages were cut off before they could be completed.\nNot comprehending the scope of the threat they faced, the bulk of the 88th mobilized against the invading Clan. Four ships were lost to advancing scouts before the Kingship was in sight. At the sight of it, CO Commander Sylvie Randall made two snap decisions; first, to send out comm drones requesting reinforcements, knowing that it might take up to two days for reinforcements to arrive; second, to retreat back to Crion to organize and defend civilian convoys. It was this decision that allowed over three million inhabitants to escape with their lives.\nBy the time the 2nd UEE Naval Fleet arrived, 49 SE Hours later, there was nothing left to do but rescue any remaining people and abandon the system. The 88th Squadron, along with the Caliban system, were lost. It is estimated that over five and a half million people died, though no official numbers have ever been released.\nNo attempts were immediately made to reclaim Caliban. Though the Kingship responsible for the bulk of casualties in battle returned to Vanduul space soon after its victory, UEE forces held off on moving in until casualties could be assessed. The UEE announced in 2891 that there were no active plans to retake Caliban until the Vanduul threat could be fully neutralized. In 2945, military strategists began to discuss possible future campaigns into the system to rout the Vanduul encampments.\nHistorians believe that the decades of Vanduul absence in Caliban, combined with a thinly-spread military, poor system-wide sensor maintenance, and an incomplete understanding of Vanduul intentions were what led to the invaders' decisive victory. Though the Tiber, Virgil, and Orion systems had already been abandoned to the Vanduul, military strategists did not foresee an attack of that strength on Caliban. The 88th Squadron was there in full force, but one squadron was not enough to stand against the firepower of a Kingship. In honor of their sacrifice, Squadron 88, redubbed the Lost Squadron, was officially retired from the UEE Navy.\nVanduul Harvesters are actively consuming what is left of the Caliban system. Crion, once a thriving, lush world, is now devastated. There are no known Human inhabitants in the system.\n",
    "San\u2019tok.y\u0101i": "The San\u2019tok.y\u0101i is a medium fighter manufactured by Aopoa for the Human market that debuted at the 2948 Intergalatic Aerospace Expo. Over a decade of intelligence collected by various branches of the United Empire of Earth (UEE) confirms that the ship is a near exact replica of a front line medium fighter utilized by the Xi\u2019an military. Though it has been adapted for Human pilots, it retains the dexterity and tight handling long observed in its Xi\u2019an precursor.\n",
    "Min 1d": "Min 1d is the most distant moon from the rogue planet Min I in the unclaimed Min system. Unlike the other moons in its system, it doesn't experience tidal heating, and has no detectable tectonic activity. Its surface is nearly saturated with craters. So many objects have made impact with Min 1d that some craters have overlapped others or formed multi-ringed impact structures. Outlaw groups are known to maintain camps in some of the larger craters.\n",
    "Schwester (Chronos II)": "Schwester (Chronos II) is an uninhabitable planet located second from the sun of the Chronos system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). In 2925, a Senate attach\u00e9 was tasked with creating a progress report on a cluster of harvesting and refining facilities that had been constructed to draw resources for the Synthworld project from Schwester's dense atmosphere. When she arrived, she discovered that the facilities were never actually built. After an investigation, Ellie Kanis, senior foreman of the project, was found guilty of skimming from the project fund. The fallout from the scandal and the vast amount of credits she and her co-conspirators stole resurrected public debate against the overall cost of the Synthworld project.\n",
    "Fall of Virgil": "The Fall of Virgil refers to the 2 January 2737 invasion of the Virgil system by the Vanduul directly after the conclusion of the Siege of Tiber. United Empire of Earth (UEE) forces, depleted after four years of battle, were unable to mount a suitable defense against the invading Vanduul, who pursued them once Tiber fell. Although the system was lost, the UEE Navy was able to cover the retreat of over one million refugees.\n",
    "Min I": "Min I is the rogue planet that forms the heart of the unclaimed Min system. Like other rogue planets, it may have been ejected from its original planetary system, or it may have formed without ever having been gravitationally bound to a star. Its four moons suggest that it may have had its own accretion disk. Although there is no sun to create light, tidal heating generates enough friction in the interiors of Min I's two inner moons to sustain ongoing geological activity, creating conditions that have given rise to life on Min 1b.\n",
    "Scott Childress": "Dr. Scott Childress (2032 - 2121) was the head engineer of the team of scientists at Roberts Space Industries (RSI) that created the first Human-made quantum drive in 2075. His doctoral thesis, A new framework for the construction of high-speed spacecraft engines, caught the attention of RSI founder Chris Roberts, who hired Childress soon after his graduation from the Fairchild Institute of Science and Technology in 2061. Allowing travel at 1/100th the speed of light, the RSI quantum core engine developed under the leadership of Dr. Childress ushered in a new age of space exploration within the Sol system and is generally credited as laying the groundwork for Humanity\u2019s expansion into the stars.\n",
    "Min System": "The Min system is an unclaimed system of four moons that orbit the rogue planet Min I. Discovered in 2473 by the mining concern the Hathor Group, it was a company secret until 2672, when the Hathor Group suffered a hack that leaked Min's location. Tall tales began to circulate among outlaw groups about a strange, sunless system haunted by glowing ghosts. Min's existence was officially revealed to the United Empire of Earth (UEE) in 2702, when Advocacy agent Hiram Quereshi tracked a smuggling ring through the Ellis-Min jump point. The UEE determined that the system was not worth developing and left it unclaimed. The only permanent settlement in Min was established on Min 1b by researchers, outlaws, and survivalists in 2816.\n",
    "Ferron I": "Ferron I is a small mesoplanet that orbits closest to the sun of the Ferron system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). While it appears to be spheroid to the naked eye, recent measurements of its surface confirm that it is misshapen enough to possibly fit the definition of a protoplanet.\n",
    "Mining Probe": "A mining probe is a device that can propel itself through zero gravity environments and latch on to a celestial body in order to collect a sample of it for evaluation. Some mining probes are fully automated, performing analysis and sending results back to their ship of origin without manual interference. Probes are typically used in asteroid or other extraplanetary mining.\n",
    "Scythe": "The \u201cScythe\u201d is the official United Empire of EarthNavy (UEEN) designation for a standard fighter operated by Vanduul forces. Having been encountered by Humans for decades, they have become visually synonymous with the terror of Vanduul raids. Specialty spacecraft manufacturer Esperia produces a flyable replica of the Scythe, and is used as an aggressor in UEEN training units. Esperia has made an extremely limited number of Scythe replicas available to civilian hobbyists. Some pilots who capture Vanduul Scythes convert them for Human use, often with the aid of Esperia's resources.\n",
    "Ferron II": "Ferron II is a coreless, uninhabited planet in the Ferron system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Second from the system's sun, its relative position makes it only a tenuous candidate for terraforming. Ever since its neighbor Asura (Ferron III) ran dry of resources, many small mining consortiums set up operations there, hoping to discover resources that major companies consider too unprofitable to harvest. The Governors Council of Asura has held multiple debates over the past decade on whether to fund a private company to terraform Ferron II on their behalf.\n",
    "Mira Ngo": "Mira Ngo (2891 - present) is Senator of Terra (Terra III) (2936 - present), and the youngest person to have ever been elected to the United Empire of Earth (UEE)Senate. She was one of the final five candidates running in the 2950 Imperator election. A third generation Senator, she has long championed Transitionalist party policies such as relocating the capital of the UEE from Earth (Sol III) to Terra. On 10 October 2949, the day she announced her candidacy for Imperator, her home was burglarized. Shortly thereafter personal files were released that revealed ties between the Ngo family and multiple privately-owned Terra construction companies. In addition to the relocation of the UEE\u2019s capital, her campaign promises included the restoration and preservation of historic buildings on Earth, a restructure of funding to Synthworld and the Vanduul war effort, and criminal justice reforms to ease jail sentences for people convicted of nonviolent crimes.\n",
    "Se'kith (Th.us'\u016bng III)": "Se'kith (Th.us'\u016bng III) is a terrestrial planet in the Th.us'\u016bng system, Xi'an Empire (SaoXy'an), and is the third world from its sun. Soon after its MXY III.802 (SEY 2483) discovery, the Xi'an government designated it as a testbed for new terraforming and geohacking technologies. These endeavors were abandoned in MXY III.838 (SEY 2530), when Human terraforming company Gaia Planet Services dispatched a survey team to the planet without oversight from the United Planets of Earth (UPE) government. They were taken into custody by the military, where they were held captive until the UPE agreed to reveal the extent of their territory and the locations of all their systems. This was the first encounter between Human and Xi'an, and historians credit tensions arising from this incident as one of the primary causes of the Xi'an-Human Cold War (MXY III.838 - III.1044 / SEY 2530 - 2793).\n",
    "Ferron IV": "Ferron IV is a dense gas giant that is located farthest from the sun of the Ferron system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Because it has an especially active electrical field, ships with sensitive avionics are advised not to fly too close to it, lest it cause their systems to malfunction. Bands of outlaws have been known to lurk just outside the danger zone, waiting to prey on malfunctioning ships.\n",
    "Second Imperial Age": "The Second Imperial Age, ruled by House Xy.\u014d, was the shortest dynasty in Xi'an history, lasting over 1700 MXY. During this time, Xi'an explorers discovered multiple star systems and expanded the borders of the Xi'an Empire (SaoXy'an). In MXY II.914 (SEY 291), they achieved first contact with the Kr'thak culture and attempted to establish a trade relationship. After several decades of strained relations, the Spirit Wars (II.961 - II.1735 / SEY 351 - 1342) erupted, ravaging the latter half of the Age. The entirety of House Xy.\u014d was killed in a bombing incursion by the Kr'thak in II.1706 (SEY 1305). This began the Dark (II.1706 - II.1824 / SEY 1305 - 1457), an era in which the Xi'an Empire had no official Imperial House. Xi'an historians group the Dark in with the Second Imperial Age, formally ending it at the ascension of House Kr.\u0113 to the imperial throne in II.1824 (SEY 1457).\n",
    "mobiGlas": "mobiGlas is a multi-purpose mobile computing device made by microTech and first released in 2818. It has strong hardware and software capabilities that facilitate accessing Spectrum, viewing vids, organizing information, downloading and storing data, personal communications, and a variety of other functions. The device is ubiquitous enough among Humans that the United Empire of Earth (UEE) conducts its census via mobiGlas. Competitors have released their own versions of the technology under different names; however, the word \u201cmobiGlas\u201d has entered the standard lexicon as a genericized term.\n",
    "Ferron System": "The Ferron system is a planetary system in the United Empire of Earth (UEE) that consists of one mesoplanet, one coreless planet, one terrestrial planet, one gas giant, and an F-type star. Discovered by Pali Laumet in 2460, it was one of the wealthiest systems in the UEE until 2791, when Linton Messer XI accused its populace of harboring political dissidents. Wealthy Citizens and Messer loyalists fled, taking large amounts of funds with them. Then, in 2832, Shubin Interstellar announced profit losses for the first time ever, signaling that most of Ferron's mineral resources were depleted. More businesses pulled out, triggering further economic devastation.\n",
    "Fiona Messer": "Fiona Messer (2768-unknown) was the younger sister of Linton Messer XI, and after his death, became the last surviving member of the Messer dynasty of United Empire of Earth (UEE) Imperators. After working with her brother to usurp power from their father Ulysses, she engaged in seditious activities with elements inside the UEE to remove Linton from power and inherit his position. The intelligence she shared with the resistance group Tide helped spark the anti-Messer revolution. After the footage of the Massacre of Garron II leaked onto the Spectrum and the uprising began, Fiona noted in her personal log that it was spreading too quickly to control. Historians speculate she went on the run to avoid capture and the execution that awaited her brother. Her whereabouts after this point remain unknown.\n",
    "Second Sister (Kilian II)": "The Second Sister (Kilian II) is a protoplanet in the Kilian system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Misshapen and low in mass, it is theorized that the Second Sister was trapped in the orbit of the First Sister (Kilian I) as it was passing through the system. The UEE Navy uses the Second Sister as a testing ground for weapons. Due to this, access to the Second Sister is restricted.\n",
    "MOLE": "The MOLE is a medium mining spacecraft developed by Argo Astronautics. Its name is an acronym of the ship's primary function as a multi-operator laser extractor. Designed to support a crew of up to four, the MOLE can be used for longer-term mining missions in remote areas of space. It is equipped with twenty-four mineral pods that can be detached and delivered to cargo vessels or shipping centers when full, and has three mining stations that can be operated independently of one another. In 2949, the MOLE debuted at the Intergalactic Aerospace Expo (IAE) and was featured on an episode of Whitley's Guide.\n",
    "Fire Rats": "The Fire Rats are a criminal organization and religious cult based in the Pyro system. It originated in 2563, when a group of former Pyrotechnic Amalgamated workers found themselves abandoned on Bloom (Pyro III) after their employer declared bankruptcy. Forced to eke out a living or perish, they took up residence in their former barracks. It is rumored that when resources began to run low, a large cargo ship that had been hit by a powerful stellar flare crashed near their settlement, granting them a bounty of supplies. This is believed to be the origin of their reverence for Pyro's star and its especially violent stellar activity. Today, the Fire Rats are known for shipjacking, and for sporting scars from repeated, intentional exposure to stellar flares.\n",
    "Monox (Pyro II)": "Monox (Pyro II) is the second planet from the sun of the Pyro system. Nicknamed \"Monox\" for the deadly carbon monoxide in its atmosphere, it has a temperate climate, and was seen as a viable candidate for terraforming shortly after its discovery. However, its proximity to the system's volatile sun made it dangerous for Human habitation, and the United Nations of Earth (UNE) refused to clear it for terraformation, instead allowing corporations to harvest its natural resources. Undeterred by the potential risk, outlaws eventually took up residence on the planet when the last corporations pulled out of Pyro in the 26th century.\n",
    "Second Tevarin War": "The Second Tevarin War was an armed conflict between the Tevarin and the United Empire of Earth that lasted from 2603 to 2610. It began when Corath'thal, a Tevarin warlord, launched a campaign to take back the Tevarin homeworld, Jalan (Elysium IV), from the UEE. Lacking the numbers and resources of the First Tevarin War, the Tevarin waged a protracted, guerilla-based campaign over the next seven years. When it became clear to Corath\u2019thal that the Tevarin were going to be defeated after the Battle of Centauri, he and his remaining forces removed the thermal shielding from their ships and dove into the atmosphere of Jalan. Their self-immolation prompted the Tevarin to cast off the culture that had failed them and fully assimilate into the UEE under the rule of Deacon Messer II.\n",
    "Sector (Space)": "A sector of space is a physical area of space within a planetary system. Sectors are used to provide orientation to navigators and pilots in areas which would otherwise have no direction markers. To define a sector, cartographers typically lay a three dimensional grid over a planetary system and chart areas into equal sections. Once this is approved by the government, official sectors are declared and released to the public. Sizes of sectors will vary depending on a system. Human and Xi\u2019an governments both utilize sectors in mapping.\n",
    "Fire Team Five": "Fire Team Five is a Human Spectrum show that ran for eleven seasons from 2913 to 2924. It followed a group of mercenaries operating on the edge of human space. Episodes typically began with the group accepting a deceptively rewarding mission that would force them to choose between their morals and their credit balances. Fire Time Five was a leading example of the 2910s frontier fad, which saw a high volume of popular culture offering a romanticized view of the Human Colonial Expansion Era (2380-2530).\n",
    "MPUV-1C (Argo Cargo)": "The MPUV-1C (\"Argo Cargo\") is a single-pilot utility spacecraft manufactured by Argo Astronautics. Built for the loading and unloading of cargo containers from orbital spacecraft and installations, the MPUV-1C's design was based on Argo's Orbital Utility Craft (OUC), their first foray into shipbuilding. The MPUV-1C allows larger cargo ships that would otherwise be incapable of making planetary landfall to transfer goods to orbital waystations, as well as planetside.\n",
    "FireStorm Kinetics": "FireStorm Kinetics is a Human spacecraft weapons manufacturer headquartered on Cascom (Castra II). Originally an exclusive contractor for the military, FireStorm built rockets for capital ships and torpedoes for military bombers. They have since expanded to the civilian market, and have added missiles and rocket pods to their production line.\n",
    "MPUV-1P (Argo Personnel)": "The MPUV-1P (\"Argo Personnel\") is a single-pilot utility spacecraft manufactured by Argo Astronautics. Intended for the loading and unloading of personnel from orbital spacecraft and installations, the MPUV-1P is a variant of the MPUV-1C cargo ferry, replacing the 1C's cargo area with a habitable space. This allows it to shuttle passengers between space and planetside locations.\n",
    "Sektor8": "Sektor8 is the pseudonym of a street artist who lives and works on Rytif (Bremen II), United Empire of Earth(UEE). They specialize in colorful, abstract pieces that they put up on public buildings over the course of a single evening.

    "First Contact Day": "First Contact Day is a holiday celebrated by Humans in the United Empire of Earth (UEE) to commemorate the moment they first made contact with civilizations outside their own. On 12 June 2438, explorer Vernon Tar encountered a Banu pilot in the Davien system. Though he initially believed the Banu\u2019s ship was another Human attempting to survey the same area of space, he soon realized his mistake and sent his coordinates to the United Nations of Earth (UNE). In response, a diplomatic team led by General Neal Socolovich arrived to smooth out the situation. The Banu Protectorate made formal contact two weeks later, and signed the Interstellar Peace and Trade Accord in October 2438. Humans celebrate the holiday by cooking or purchasing meals from alien cultures, holding parties or small gatherings, and shopping at Banu, Tevarin, and Xi\u2019an-owned businesses.\n",
    "Municipal Transit Line (Mu-Sit)": "The Municipal Transit Line (Mu-Sit) is a transit system located in the city of Quinton on Angeli (Croshaw II) in the United Empire of Earth (UEE). Developed under a government contract by Argo Astronautics, it was based on the company's radial networked transit hub in Port Renatus, Mars (Sol IV). While it is functionally identical to the Prime Transit Monorail, also developed by Argo, the Municipal Line covers a significantly larger area.\n",
    "Selene (Vega III)": "Selene is a terrestrial planet in the Vega system, United Empire of Earth (UEE) that was minimally terraformed to Human specifications. From 2550 to 2712, Selene was a center of industry, trade, tourism, and culture, serving as a key travel hub in the UEE. After the Battle of Orion in 2712, Selene experienced a sharp drop in population as inhabitants of the system fled to other worlds in fear of an imminent Vanduul invasion. In 2737, after the dual losses of Virgil and Tiber, Vega became the closest Human-inhabited territory to Vanduul space. While refugees from Virgil and Tiber filled in some of the gaps left by its fled populace, Selene\u2019s population numbers never reverted to pre-Vanduul levels. Today, many of Selene\u2019s buildings and construction projects are abandoned.\n",
    "First Imperial Age": "The First Imperial Age was the longest dynasty Xi\u2019an history. Spanning almost fifteen thousand Xi'an years, it began with the crowning of the first Emperor Ru'a in MXY I.0 (19668 BCE), several years after the loss of the Xi'an homeworld RyiXy'an (Hyoton III) in 19770 BCE. During this era, the Xi'an discovered jump points, established the Civil Service (P\u014d't.\u014dngp.\u016b), codified the tenets of Li'tova into common law, and first terraformed worlds outside their home planetary system. The Age came to an end in I.14680 (878 BCE), when Emperor Se'ang se Ru'a, the final heir of his house, stepped down to make way for Y.ah'a se Xy.\u014d, the oldest daughter of her House and the first Emperor of the Second Age.\n",
    "Murray Cup": "The Murray Cup is a spacecraft race held annually at the end of racing season in the Ellis system. Dating back to 2467, when terraforming workers of Gaia Planet Services unofficially raced one another to pass the time, the Murray Cup is now the most prestigious event in modern racing. It utilizes natural and artificial obstacles to create two challenges. In the Classic race, pilots are ranked on their speed and navigational skill. In the Blitz race, pilots are allowed to engage in limited combat to disable their competitors.\n",

MISC was one of the first corporations in the United Empire of Earth (UEE) to sustain a tech-trade partnership with the Xi\u2019an.\n",
    "SELF-LAND": "SELF-LAND is a Human spacecraft hangar manufacturer responsible for a series of modular berths produced under the same name. It was founded in the mid-29th century by Peter Weatherman, a tanker owner whose ship was stripped of components after he was jumped by a gang of thieves in an open hangar. As a result of this experience, Weatherman started his company to create a system of enclosed, private hangars that could be easily placed at any settlement and could rely on a unified supply chain for maintenance and support. The SELF-LAND hangars sold well, and have since become a common sight around the United Empire of Earth (UEE).\n",
    "First Jump Day": "First Jump Day is a United Empire of Earth (UEE) holiday celebrated on 10 April that recognizes the day Nick Croshaw became the first Human to discover a jump point. In the mid-23rd century, spacecraft in the Sol system began to vanish without explanation in a region nicknamed the Neso Triangle. The mystery attracted multiple scientists and explorers interested in pinning down the reason behind the disappearances. After ten years studying the area, astrophysicist Nick Croshaw discovered and successfully navigated a jump tunnel via a personally-modified quantum drive and discovered a new planetary system. The system was named Croshaw in his honor. The holiday was established in 2380 after the formation of the United Nations of Earth (UNE) government. Many commemorate the day by traversing a jump or by searching for new jump points.\n",
    "Mustang Alpha": "The Mustang Alpha is a single-seat civilian spacecraft in the Mustang line of spacecraft developed and sold by Consolidated Outland. It was developed to the specifications of company founder and CEO Silas Koerner, who intended it to offer radical competition to Roberts Space Industries\u2019 Aurora line of ships. The Alpha can be purchased with an optional cargo expansion. Mustang variants include the Mustang Beta touring craft, the Mustang Gamma racing ship and the Mustang Delta militia spacecraft.\n",
    "Senate": "The Senate is a governing body responsible for writing, evaluating, amending, and passing or rejecting legislation, setting the governmental budget on a yearly basis, advising the Imperator. It is composed of elected representatives from each recognized planet within the borders of the United Empire of Earth.

    "First Tevarin War": "The First Tevarin War was an intersystem conflict between the Tevarin and the United Planets of Earth (UPE). The Tevarin declared war with Humans in 2541, shortly after first contact. The motivations behind the war were complex; it was both a bid for the Tevarin to claim UPE-controlled territory to assuage their overpopulation problem and a consequence of the high cultural value the Tevarin as a people placed on combat. The war was responsible for countless advances in spacecraft technology. Ivar Messer, then an officer in the UPE Army, was propelled to power following the Battle of Idris IV, a key conflict in the First Tevarin War. The Tevarin were defeated in 2546.\n",
    "Mustang Beta": "The Mustang Beta is a variant of the Mustang civilian spacecraft developed by Consolidated Outland.

An electronic warfare platform, it was created to be used in the suppression of enemy air defense and tracking capabilities. The remodel replaces some of the Vanguard\u2019s direct armament with an external electronic countermeasures pod, decoy missiles, and a set of electro-magnetic pulse (EMP) charges to be used in asymmetrical warfare operations. While it was designed to United Empire of Earth Navy (UEEN) specifications, Aegis has made the Vanguard Sentinel available for civilian and corporate users.\n",
    "Fizzz": "Fizzz is a carbonated soft drink manufactured by the Bevic Group, a Human company that manufactures a wide variety of branded food and beverages. It debuted in 2777, after a team at the Bevic Group made a research breakthrough in adapting the flavor of the soursop fruit into beverage form. Initial sales of the soda were so high that a black market sprung up around the purchasing and reselling of cases of Fizzz until the Bevic Group was able to increase production and resolve its supply chain issues in 2779. Fizzz mainly featured fruit flavors until 2893, when they added a cola flavor to the lineup. Other popular flavors include muscat, peach, and triple berry.\n",
    "Serling (Horus I)": "Serling (Horus I) is the first planet from the sun of the Horus system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Tidally locked to its star, its day half is hot and cloudy and its dark half is icy and cold. A permanent wind system that exchanges air from each side keeps the climate from veering into life-threatening extremes and creates habitable conditions along the perpetually-twilit solar terminator. Further colonized by Humans after the dissolution of the Perry Line in 2793, it is a center of trade between the UEE and the Xi'an Empire, which is connected to the Horus system via two jump points.\n",
    "Flashfire Systems": "Flashfire Systems is a Human engineering firm and weapon mount manufacturer headquartered on Angeli (Croshaw II). Founded in 2904 as a laser weapons manufacturer, Flashfire nearly went bankrupt after their line of standard lasers failed to gain traction in the market. Flashfire redirected its manufacturing efforts to universally usable weapon mounts after the company was purchased by Garvin Snarm.\n",
    "Mustang Gamma": "The Mustang Gamma is a variant of the Mustang civilian spacecraft developed by Consolidated Outland. The first racer variant of the Mustang, it was later followed by the limited edition Mustang Omega. Consolidated Outland engineers reduced the overall weight of the base model for the Gamma and upgraded the standard engines. The redesign includes a general improvement in maneuverability over the standard Mustang in exchange for an overall reduction in missiles and guns.\n",
    "Severus (Kiel III)": "Severus (Kiel III) is the third planet from the sun of the Kiel system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). The sole populated planet in Kiel, Severus was historically used as a base of operations for the UEE military during the Xi'an-Human Cold War (SEY 2530 - 2793). After the fall of the Messers, the military trickled out of the system, taking resources and jobs with them, and the planet's economy went into a recession. Beginning in the early 2900s, Governor Joona Tzur recruited businesses to the planet that could capitalize on the military's abandoned infrastructure. The program was a success, and after a period of rapid growth, Severus was recognized by the UEE Senate in 2937. Severus is the central host planet for the Intergalactic Aerospace Expo.\n",
    "Mustang Omega": "The Mustang Omega is a variant of the Mustang civilian spacecraft developed by Consolidated Outland. Like the Mustang Gamma, the Omega is focused primarily on high performance racing with the addition of an upgraded fuel intake. The ship was produced via a partnership with Accelerated Mass Design, who were responsible for additional tuning and styling of the vehicle. Omegas are manufactured with a unique red paint scheme developed by underground artist Sektor8.\n",
    "Flight-of-Fancy": "The flight-of-fancy is a genetically modified plant that was created by Rayari Inc to decrease symptoms caused by airborne allergens. The fine, light pollen produced in its bright orange flowers is an antihistamine, and is easily spread via wind distribution. Thanks to this and the large broad leaves that provide ample shade when the plant reaches maturity, the flight-of-fancy is usually planted in Human cities, or in new settlements on recently terraformed worlds.\n",
    "Flo-Pets": "Flo-Pets are a bioluminescent freshwater slug indigenous to Xis (Kellog II). Despite being protected by the Fair Chance Act, Human smugglers began eluding United Empire of Earth military forces to travel to the surface to capture Flo-Pets around 2918, intending to develop them as an easily-bred compact protein source. When they proved inedible for Humans, they were instead marketed as novelty pets, which led to a brief fad that further fueled smuggling operations. Flo-pets adapt to new environments easily and discarded pets have gone on to establish populations on many Human-inhabited worlds.\n",
    "Shepherd (Tayac III)": "Shepherd is a dwarf planet, third from the sun in the Tayac system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Composed of rock and ice, it has a deep red and white surface inhospitable to life. It was nicknamed \"Shepherd\" because it orbits so closely to the outer edge of the Tayac belt that it appears to be supervising the nearby asteroids in their path around the sun.\n",
    "Mya (Leir II)": "Mya is the second planet from the sun of the Leir system. Although it was discovered in 2677, it remained undeveloped until 2743, when Galor Messer IX sold the terraforming and mining rights of Leir II to Hatfield & Harding to fund his long-term project to redesign UEE government buildings. The company hired University of Persei Analytical Research and Quantification (UPARQ) terraforming expert Dr. Marcus Fayel to lead the project. Over the next few decades, Fayel oversaw operations while running a clandestine mining operation of his own and cultivating a base of devoted followers. In 2812, Fayel abruptly ended all communication from the system to Hatfield & Harding and the United Empire of Earth (UEE) at large. Subsequent attempts by the company to retake the planet were violently rebuffed by what turned out to be a cult with Fayel at the helm that called themselves the Sun's Eye Fellowship. They renamed the planet Mya. Now known as the Outsiders for their philosophy of remaining away from the \"impure\" influence of the UEE, this fringe society conducts trade primarily with the Banu Protectorate in order to remain \"pure.\"\n",
    "Sherman": "Sherman is a settlement on Cascom (Castra II), United Empire of Earth (UEE). Originally built as a military landing base, it was constructed above the cloud line on a mountain to make it easier for atmospheric ships to launch or land. It was changed into a civilian town at the end of the Xi'an-Human Cold War (SEY 2530 - 2793), and is now a center for trade thanks to its port.\n",
    "Fora Belt Alpha": "The Fora belt alpha is an asteroid belt in the Fora system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Smugglers in Fora typically use the belt as a drop point for contraband, which is then picked up and smuggled into the Banu Protectorate. Pirates have also been known to utilize some of the asteroids as staging areas for ambushes on haulers entering or leaving the system. The UEE has issued a travel alert advising visitors to Fora to give the area a wide berth.\n",
    "Fora I": "Fora I is a mesoplanet in the Fora system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). A hot, dry planet that closely orbits its sun, temperatures on its surface are dangerously high for most spacecraft. A ridge runs along the equator of Fora I, forming a complex system of peaks. Scientists are uncertain what caused the ridge to form, but one hypothesis suggests that the mesoplanet once had a ring system that eventually raised the ridge via collisional accretion.\n",
    "Shipping Checkpoint": "A shipping checkpoint is a government-run agency in which the cargo manifests of spacecraft are examined to make sure they are in compliance of the law. They are typically located in platforms near jump points that cross into sovereign systems, with a checkpoint on either side. The Xi\u2019an Empire and the United Empire of Earth (UEE) require by law for all spacecraft to stop at these checkpoints when crossing from one territory to another. The Banu Protectorate only enforces stoppage if the local system requires it.\n",
    "Najita": "Najita is the most populous city on Keene (Kilian VII). A coastal city, Najita was originally constructed to work in harmony with the sprawling green hills that surround it. This balance was upset in the 2800s when increasing Vanduul raids in the Caliban system frightened many of its residents to flee to Keene for military protection. Prefabricated residences were erected in the surrounding hills to house the swelling population. These new neighborhoods became permanent after the Fall of Caliban in 2884. Prominent spacecraft manufacturers Roberts Space Industries and Anvil Aerospace maintain showrooms in Najita.\n",
    "Fora II": "Fora II is a coreless terrestrial planet located in the Fora system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). After the terraformation of Hyperion (Fora III) failed, several companies attempted to terraform this planet, in spite of its location outside the system's green band. All attempts failed, forcing those who hoped to turn the system into a trading hub to finally abandon their plans.\n",
    "Nautilus": "The Nautilus is a minelayer and minesweeper spacecraft developed by Aegis Dynamics and utilized by the United Empire of Earth Navy (UEEN). It is capable of deploying several different types of mines for both offensive and area-denial purposes along simultaneous vectors in 3D space.

Its pale yellow and green-banded atmosphere surrounds a mantle made of metallic hydrogen and helium.\n",
    "Fora System": "The Fora system is a planetary system in the United Empire of Earth (UEE), and is made up of a K-type main sequence star, a mesoplanet, two terrestrial planets, a gas giant, and an ice giant. After a jump point to the Banu system Yulin from the Banshee system was discovered in 2463, developers were hopeful that Fora could become a major trade hub. However, a terraforming error created a perpetual dust storm on Fora III, the system's only potentially habitable planet. Today, the sparsely-populated system is a favorite outpost for pirates and smugglers.\n",
    "Nav-E7 Gadgets": "Nav-E7 Gadgets is a Human spacecraft component manufacturer that produces a wide range of equipment, such as scanner and radar systems, docking collars, and passenger seats. They maintain a contract with Musashi Industrial and Starflight Concern (MISC) to outfit their Freelancer line of ships with fuel tanks and long-range scanners.\n",

Lacking a solid surface, its core is composed of iron and nickel, and it has a mantle rich in ammonia, methane, and water. Deep within the planet, there are regular showers of diamond crystals.\n",
    "Ne'er": "Ne'er is a town on Branaugh II in the Branaugh system. After surveyors for the United Empire of Earth (UEE) determined that Branaugh II was not a good terraformation candidate, they abandoned the structures they lived in while evaluating the planet. After they left, a group of Tevarin then claimed the outposts and turned them into dwellings. Over time, more Tevarin arrived and more structures were built. Eventually the area became the planet's main trading hub.\n",
    "Fortified Armor": "Fortified Armor is a Human manufacturer of low-end personal armor and clothing. The company focuses on creating strictly utilitarian products that emphasize affordability over high quality. Many of their goods are built to mimic the look of high-end pieces from other companies.\n",
    "Neal Socolovich": "Neal Sovolovich (2373 - 2474) was a General in the United Nations of Earth (UNE) Army, and a key figure in the negotiation of the Banu-Human Interstellar Peace and Trade Accord, the first interspecies treaty in Human history. Born on Angeli (Croshaw II), he joined the UNE Army in 2390. He was promoted to the rank of General in 2415 after completing two deployments to the Banshee system, where he gained a reputation for his ability to settle conflicts with outlaws without opening fire. In 2430, General Socolovich was assigned a command post in the newly discovered Davien system. Historians credit his thoughtful leadership during Banu-Human First Contact in 2438 for ensuring that Humanity's initial encounter with another civilization was a peaceful one. Upon his retirement in 2441, he purchased a plot of land on his home planet and entered the winemaking business. He passed away in 2474.\n",
    "Fortress Palm": "The fortress palm is a genetically modified fruit-bearing tree with fan-shaped, palmate leaves. Created by Rayari Inc in 2930, the fortress palm was designed to provide nutrient-dense fruit for the inhabitants of newly-terraformed worlds. Additionally, it was made to be as resistant to pests as possible, with a thorny trunk detrimental to climbing and leaves that contain pain-causing alkaloids. Its fruit must be harvested via machinery or while wearing protective gear.\n",
    "Foundation Festival": "The Foundation Festival is a civic program that takes place annually in the United Empire of Earth (UEE) for the duration of the month of July. Proposed in SEY 2861 by Imperator Gayatri Deomana, the holiday endeavors to strengthen community participation by encouraging Citizens and civilians to volunteer with local and imperial organizations. Independent charitable organizations often reach volunteer capacity during the holiday, so the UEE government offers short-term volunteer opportunities such as mentorship programs and cleanup events. Civilians can submit repeated Foundation Festival volunteer work as one of many qualifications to receive Citizenship.\n",
    "Freelancer": "The Freelancer is a multi-role transport spacecraft developed by MISC and was the first vessel to be constructed as part of a unique lend-lease agreement with the Xi'an government. The ship's hull is sold in several variants that have been adapted for various alternate roles like the Freelancer DUR exploration ship, the Freelancer MAX enhanced cargo ship and the Freelancer MIS missile launcher.\n",
    "Freelancer DUR": "The Freelancer DUR is a variant of the Freelancer freighter developed by MISC. Adapted for exploration, the DUR trades some of the base Freelancer's cargo capacity in exchange for a number of adaptations intended to increase overall range and durability. These include a dedicated scanner suite, an improved jump drive, and a larger fuel supply.\n",
    "Freelancer MAX": "The Freelancer MAX is a variant of the Freelancer freighter developed by MISC. Unusually for spacecraft variants, the MAX is a total rebuild of the standard Freelancer hull rather than a redesign. Thanks to these changes, it can carry twice as much internal cargo as its parent model in exchange for sacrificing some speed and maneuverability.\n",
    "Freelancer MIS": "The Freelancer MIS is a limited-edition variant of the Freelancer freighter developed by MISC. The design replaces much of the standard Freelancer's cargo capacity with high-capacity missile magazines. The original request for the update came from the United Empire of Earth Navy (UEEN) who looked to convert the readily available commercial ship into an effective carrier-based missile boat. While some are in active military service, others have been made available in small numbers on the civilian market.\n",
    "Freeman Act": "The Freeman Act is a piece of legislation passed cooperatively by all governments on Earth (Sol III) in 2281 that created a lottery system to grant land and mineral rights to potential colonists of the Croshaw system. Revenue generated from the lottery was used to fund ongoing terraforming efforts. Winners of the lottery were granted one-way tickets to the system, eligible for use once the terraformation of Croshaw II was completed. The success of this program convinced the governments of Earth to form a new one-world government called the United Nations of Earth (UNE) in 2380.\n",
    "Front Row": "Front Row is a settlement on the surface of Lanisto (Tyrol 1a), the moon of Tyrol I in the unclaimed Tyrol system. In 2848, a series of interconnected research stations funded by multiple private institutes were constructed below the surface in old lava tunnels as a part of a project to observe the evolution of the white dwarf's potential nova. The study lost its funding in 2901, and the facility was abandoned. Shortly thereafter it was claimed by smugglers and drifters. Aware that when the star eventually goes nova they will be the first to perish, the settlement's few permanent residents have nicknamed it \"Front Row.\"\n",
    "Shoel": "Shoel is one of the only settlements on Hyperion (Fora III), United Empire of Earth. Briefly prosperous during a mining rush in the twenty-fifth century, the city fell into disrepair after mineral veins ran dry and the inhabitants abandoned it. Most of the urban sprawl is dominated by empty buildings being swallowed by HyperClay. Shoel was used as a hideout during the Messer Era (2546 - 2792) for political refugees. One of the only remaining statues of Ivar Messer I, erected under orders from Corsen Messer V in 2660 to remind the populace of their subjugation, stands at the town center. It is heavily vandalized and defaced.\n",
    "Baker II": "Baker II is a smog planet in the Baker system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). The second planet from the suns, its position in the green band would normally make it a prime candidate for colonization. However, the high-pressure, poisonous atmosphere has so far prevented any attempts at terraforming. Spacecraft that have attempted to land on Baker II have been heavily damaged by the toxic air.\n",
    "Fuego (Pyro 5e)": "Fuego is the fifth moon from the gas giant Pyro V, Pyro system. Relatively temperate but still cold, it has a mostly carbon dioxide atmosphere with small percentages of nitrogen, sulfur dioxide, and oxygen. High amounts of iron-sulfide in its soil gives its surface a yellow and black appearance. Infamous smuggler group Headhunters often utilized Fuego as a stash point for goods during their nascent years in the early 2600s.\n",
    "Nedila": "Nedila is a small town on Jalan (Elysium IV), United Empire of Earth (UEE) located in a rocky area south of the planet's capital Gemma. Many of its inhabitants are water farmers, and their harvests are distributed to the major population centers on Jalan. The town's natural hot springs were once used by ancient Tevarin as a popular public bath.\n",
    "Fujin City": "Fujin City (\u98a8\u795e\u90fd) is the capital city of Saisei (Centauri III), United Empire of Earth (UEE). Considered by environmentalists to be an achievement in urban and geodevelopment, it is one of the most verdant cities in the UEE. Traditional Japanese architecture and modern building styles blend with carefully constructed gardens and parks to create a balanced environment. A center of commerce and industry, all businesses in the city must comply with strict environmental regulations. Most traffic entering and leaving Saisei passes through Fujin. The Governors Council of Saisei has implemented a population cap in order to curb overpopulation and preserve the environment.\n",
    "Nemo 3a": "Nemo 3a, nicknamed the \"Space Whale\" by locals, is the moon of Ergo (Nemo III). A captured asteroid, it is oblong in shape with one end tapering into a smaller one. The silhouette is said to resemble a whale, an ocean mammal indigenous to the planet Earth (Sol III) but not found on Ergo. Local businesses have built a tourist industry around the moon, and sell souvenirs ranging from novelty t-shirts to replicas of the Space Whale.\n",
    "Showdown!": "Showdown! is a SSN/CAtv Human current events debate program that first began airing in 2521. In each episode, two guests of opposing views are brought on to debate key issues of the day. Showdown! has been canceled and revived multiple times. The most recent version has continuously broadcast since 2799 and is hosted by Eria Quint.\nThe host of Showdown! opens every episode with a summary of the debate topic at hand, usually a current events news story. The host then introduces guests of opposing viewpoints to present their takes on the issue and debate it with one another. Generally, two guests are present, but sometimes the host will conduct a one-on-one interview or allow three or more guests to debate with one another. As the debate progresses, the host serves as moderator, asking questions as needed. Between one and five topics are covered per episode.\nThe concept for Showdown! began in 2511, on Angeli (Croshaw II). Local politicians in Quinton would join radio news anchor Upasna Dixit to debate upcoming legislation. After nine years on the air, Dixit was approached by the now defunct news network Angeli On Air (AoA) to adapt Showdown! as a 30-minute current events debate program. Dixit signed for an undisclosed amount and began production on the new show. The first episode aired throughout Croshaw on 9 September 2521 in a late-night time slot.\nShowdown! soon became popular and was shuffled to a more popular time slot. It saw high enough ratings that in 2522, SSN/CAtv bought the rights from AoA and broadcast it for the first time to an interplanetary audience that same year. In 2523, they launched a special series of episodes where various political experts, authors, and laypeople debated the merits and drawbacks of the new United Planets of Earth government without Dixit's moderation. However, the lack of an arbiter caused conversations to go off track, leading to a drop in the show's ratings. Ratings rose again when Dixit returned in 2524.\nDuring Dixit's run as host, Showdown! covered such issues as first contact with the Xi\u2019an (2530), The outbreak of the First Tevarin War (2542 - 2546), and the ascension of Ivar Messer to the newly created office of Prime Citizen (2546). Dixit chose to retire after Ivar Messer created the position of Imperator, stating that she preferred not to lead debates on pros and cons of fascism.\nThe new host, In\u00e1cio Santos Melo, developed a confrontational moderation style in contrast to Dixit's cool and impartial one, often aligning himself against his guests in heated three-way debates. Melo was criticized by other news networks for this behavior, but Showdown! experienced an upswing in popularity. This tone became the program's norm even after Melo's retirement in 2588.\nShowdown! has been canceled and rebooted multiple times. It ran uninterrupted from 2547 to 2619. On 09 May 2619, Showdown! was canceled due to a dip in ratings. It was revived from 2648 to 2662, canceled again due to a contract dispute, and then brought back to fill an empty late-night slot from 2687 to 2697. It was one of many news programs to be censored into cancellation during the power struggle between Astrid Messer VII and Samuel Messer VIII (2697 - 2701), and wasn't revived again until 2718, three years after the ascension of Galor Messer IX. This version of Showdown! lasted until 2789, when it was censored again by the Messer government, this time for inviting SenatorTerrence Akari of Terra (Terra III) as a guest. It was revived for the fifth time in 2799 in the run-up to the ratification of the Fair Chance Act.\nSince 2799, Showdown! has been shuffled between time slots, but has not seen another cancellation. The current host, Eria Quint, took over in 2935.\n",
    "Baker III": "Baker III is an ice giant in the Baker system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). The third planet from the suns, its atmosphere is white with deep veins of blue.

    "Nemo I": "Nemo I is a protoplanet that orbits closest to the star of the Nemo system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). An extremely thin atmosphere of oxygen, sodium, and hydrogen surrounds it, essentially identical to the vacuum of space. In 2407, a scanning device advertised as the next-gen in resource-detection technology called the MicroProbe delivered false reports detailing vast stores of untapped minerals under the protoplanet's surface. The local news published an expos\u00e9 of the shoddy technology before any prospectors could attempt to excavate.\n",
    "Shubin Interstellar": "Shubin Interstellar is a major Human corporation headquartered on microTech (Stanton IV) in the United Empire of Earth (UEE). Founded as an investment group, it acquired the terraforming conglomerate Worldmaker in the late 25th century, and Fulcrum Mining Associates in the mid-26th. It sells mining equipment and operates mining facilities, factories, support pipelines, and other industrial centers in nearly every UEE-held star system.\n",
    "Fulcrum Mining Associates": "Fulcrum Mining Associates was a Human mining concern that operated from 2448 through its sale to Shubin Interstellar in 2554. The company was one of the first Human off-world mining concerns. In 2554, Fulcrum reached out to Shubin with a bid to sell off unwanted corporate assets in the Centauri system. Shubin opted to purchase Fulcrum outright instead and by 2585 had fully retired the company's branding.\n",
    "Baker IV": "Baker IV is the fourth planet from the suns of the Baker system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). A terrestrial, coreless planet, it has no magnetic field, but many valuable mineral deposits. Shubin Interstellar maintains an outpost there named GIO. The planet is lightly populated by the overseers and workers of Shubin's mining operations.\n",
    "Nemo II": "Nemo II is the second planet from the sun of the Nemo system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Over the millennia, countless meteor strikes have impacted the surface of Nemo II, creating a visually dynamic landscape of craters and mountains. In the distant past, it was volcanically active, as evidenced by its ancient lava flows and calderas. It has a relatively robust atmosphere of carbon dioxide, oxygen, and sulfur dioxide that is in the process of dissipating due to a lack of replenishment sources.\n",
    "Gainey (Odin 1a)": "Gainey (Odin 1a) is the former moon of Odin I, Odin system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). After Odin I was destroyed, it slipped into a stable orbit around the system's sun close to its parent planet's remains. It has a breathable atmosphere, and was the home of many fracking operations and gas refinement plants until tectonic instability forced the companies to leave.\n",
    "Baker System": "The Baker system is a planetary system in the United Empire of Earth (UEE). Discovered in 2522, It consists of two K-type main sequence stars and four uninhabited worlds. The only major Human settlements in the system are Xenia, a Covalex shipping hub, and GIO, a Shubin Interstellar mining outpost. Cargo ships transporting goods between the Xi'an Empire (SaoXy'an) and the UEE often use Xenia as a pit stop. On an irregular basis, Baker hosts an unofficial racing event known as the Able Baker Challenge.\n",
    "Siege of Tiber": "The Siege of Tiber was a key battle between the United Empire of Earth (UEE) and invading Vanduul. Lasting from 2732 to 2736, it consisted of extensive ground and air engagements, mass bombings, and a military blockade from the Orion and Vector (VS-1) jump points by Vanduul forces and the Virgil and Oberon jump points by UEE forces. Losses were heavy on both sides; conservative estimates put Human and Vanduul combined casualties in the lower millions. The Siege ended with UEE defeat on 29 December 2736, when a Kingship jumped into the system from Orion. Half of the UEE\u2019s forces in Tiber were destroyed in the subsequent battle. After such heavy losses, the UEE was forced to cede Tiber to the Vanduul.\nOn 18 February 2712 Tiber\u2019s neighboring system, Orion, was unexpectedly lost to the Vanduul. UEE forces that had defended Orion fell back to the Tiber system and formed a secondary defense line in anticipation of another invasion. However, the Vanduul remained in Orion to harvest its resources, and showed no intention of pursuing the retreating UEE ships. After several tense months, UEE leadership concluded that another unified incursion of allied Vanduul Clans at the scale of the Battle of Orion was unlikely to occur. The Imperator authorized the buildup of military forces at an accelerated pace to fortify the system.\nRegular intelligence-gathering missions were launched into Orion to spy on the Vanduul. The system didn't have a single incident until 04 February 2726, when a solitary Vanduul Blade exited the Orion jump point. By 16 November 2726, Vanduul Clans were regularly launching raids on Tiber. It seemed that another invasion might be on the horizon.\nOn 19 April 2732, a large Clan took and held the Tiber-Orion jump point. The UEE responded by dispatching the 81st, 22nd, 6th, and 31st Battle Groups, commanded by Grand Admiral Tesca Halimeade, to eradicate the invaders. Key ships in the Battle Groups were sent to guard the Virgil and Oberon jump points and defend other areas identified as potentially threatened. In a surprise move, Halimeade issued orders that no ship was to directly engage the Vanduul around the Orion jump point, hoping that a defensive position would stall the invasion and give him enough time to find a diplomatic solution to the conflict.\nBy mid-2733, multiple Clans drawn into Tiber by the continued fighting were battling one another over space stations and outposts as often as they clashed with UEE forces. Most of the UEE\u2019s capital ships remained in dock during this time as Halimeade searched for a way to communicate with the Vanduul. By early 2734, three of the Clans that had emerged victorious from repeated battles against the other Clans launched separate concentrated assaults on Tiber II. They tore through the UEE\u2019s lines of defense, dropped Harvesters, and established encampments across the planet.\nWith the loss of the Tiber II, Halimeade was forced to abandon his strategy and go on the offensive. The main flagship of the 31st long docked at INS Aniene, the UEES Aquilon, led the fleet to the outskirts of Tiber II in order to lure the Vanduul camped there into attacking. The strategy paid off; most Vanduul on the planet eagerly joined the fray, leaving their on-ground encampments only lightly guarded. As the battle continued, strike teams from the 81st and 22nd Battle Groups entered Tiber II\u2019s atmosphere with little resistance and conducted aerial bombardments of the Vanduul strongholds there, destroying the majority in under a few hours. The decimated Clans fled the system.\nFinally committed to total war, Halimeade used this bait-and-switch tactic again and again to reclaim lost territory. For over a year, Vanduul numbers slowly dwindled. However, due to more Clans entering Tiber as often as defeated Clans fled it, progress was not going as fast as UEE authorities would have liked.\nOn 04 November 2735, a large Clan appeared in what seemed to be an insignificant part of the system. The UEES Aquilon and a selection of support vessels, personally led by Halimeade, went to investigate the situation. As they approached, hundreds of Vanduul poured through a previously-unknown jump point from the Vanduul system designated Vector, ambushing Halimede. The Aquilon was destroyed. All aboard were lost.\nAdmiral Mira Triolo assumed authority over the four Battle Groups in Tiber after Halimeade\u2019s death, and her aggressive strategy of confronting the Vanduul head-on resulted in a sharp increase in casualties. Under her command, the UEE made multiple attempts over the next year to expel the Vanduul, but no attack was successful; Clans continued to enter Tiber from the Orion and Vector systems, and the Harvesters at work on Tiber II kept supply levels high. UEE ground troops and bombers would succeed in destroying one Harvester only for two more to be dropped in its place. Morale was low. It seemed that as long as the Vanduul held Tiber II, it would be impossible to retake the system.\nOn 07 September 2736, Imperator Galor Messer IX ordered the military to bomb the planet into oblivion. The bombing, conducted by the 6th Battle Group on 15 November, annihilated all Vanduul encampments on Tiber II, and the planet itself was rendered to ruin. Emboldened by this success, UEE forces routed Vanduul encampments from the asteroid belt, chasing them through the Vector jump point. By 29 November, the UEE held Tiber II, the belt, and the Vector jump point. The only Vanduul left in the system set up a defensive perimeter around the jump point to Orion. Unless they retreated, their supplies would eventually run out. The 22nd and 31st returned to MacArthur for much-needed repairs, while the 81st and 6th remained behind to pick off the rest of the Vanduul. It seemed that the UEE was finally on the brink of victory.\nOn 29 December 2736, a Kingship, a powerful class of Vanduul capital ship that had not been encountered by Humans since the Battle of Orion in 2712, entered Tiber through the Orion jump point. The combined power of the Kingship and the enormous Clan that accompanied it overwhelmed the 81st; three-quarters of its ships were wiped out in a 13 hour period, and INS Aniene was destroyed. The remainder of the Battle Group fell back to the INS Flavus before receiving order to retreat into Virgil. Admiral Triolo and the 6th stayed behind to hold the line against the Kingship. Reports from survivors indicate that the 6th was able to deal modest damage to the Kingship before losing Triolo, all its capital ships, and the majority of its carriers. As the last of the 6th Battle Group retreated into Oberon, having been cut off from Virgil, Tiber was fully surrendered to the Vanduul.\nThe UEE had poured all its resources into holding Tiber. When the Vanduul launched an attack on the Virgil system immediately after Tiber\u2019s loss, the UEEN was unable to mount a sufficient defense to stop them. The beaten remains of the 81st Battle Group fought off the Vanduul fleet while Squadron 214 aided the civilians evacuating from Virgil I, conducting multiple runs back and forth from Virgil through the Vega jump point. Given the choice between performing a final run and remaining safe, the 214th chose to go into Virgil one last time. Thanks to their actions, over a million civilians escaped from Virgil I.\nThere was every expectation that Vega would be the Vanduul\u2019s next target. Instead, the Vanduul would not launch another massed attack on UEE territory until the Fall of Caliban in 2884.\nToday, Tiber remains a Vanduul stronghold. Harvesters continue to chew through the system\u2019s resources, strengthening any Clan that passes through the area. Because Tiber is connected to both Oberon and Virgil, it provides the Vanduul with easy raiding access to UEE territory. Oberon and Vega are frequent raiding targets. The UEE conducts periodic bombing runs to Tiber, targeting Vanduul encampments and Harvesters on Tiber II along with bases in the asteroid belt, but has been unable so far to reclaim the system.\n",
    "Nemo System": "The Nemo system is a planetary system in the United Empire of Earth (UEE) with three planets and an F-type main sequence star. Officially discovered in 2364 by Dae-ho Ochoa of NemoCo, the system's provenance came under question when Tadmor Terraforming Concern filed a lawsuit claiming that Ochoa had discovered the system in 2362 during his time working as a security contractor for their company, and had quit Tadmor in order to keep the discovery to himself. However, the lawsuit was dismissed due to a lack of evidence. The ocean world Ergo (Nemo III) is the system's only populated planet, with so few landmasses that its inhabitants have built their cities on artificial islands.\n",

    "NemoCo": "NemoCo is a former terraforming and mining corporation that is credited with the discovery of the Nemo system in 2364. Founded by Jawahir Norman, Sandeep Ellis, Demont Mau, and Dae-ho Ochoa, it obtained most of its early equipment from the Tadmor Terraforming Concern when the company was struggling with legal problems. Soon after, NemoCo found a jump point in the Fora system and named the new system Nemo, an acronym of the founders' surnames. The company was prosperous for many years thanks to the vast oil reserves on Ergo (Nemo III). However, in 2704 NemoCo went bankrupt while attempting to convert outdated oil rigs into tourist destinations.\n",
    "Galactic Tour (Galactic Gear)": "Galactic Tour (formerly Galactic Gear) is a Spectrum show hosted by Jax McCleary that reviews spacecraft after putting them through outlandish tests. Debuting in 2931 as Galactic Gear, the show featured McCleary and a rotating cast of friends and guest stars who accompanied McCleary in his test flights. Voyager Direct purchased the show in 2945 and renamed and relaunched it as Galactic Tour in 2946 A new host, Rahul Menon, took over after McCleary left in 2947. Since it first aired, Galactic Tour has been popular with audiences for the unusual methods it uses to evaluate spacecraft and for its frank and often comedic commentary.\n",
    "Banded Fessle": "The banded fessle is a carnivorous saltwater fish indigenous to the warmer areas of the Animas Sea on Terra (Terra III), Terra System, United Empire of Earth (UEE). A popular aquarium fish, banded fessles in captivity have been bred to encourage docility and to accentuate their deep blue vertical stripes.\nBanded fessles are identifiable by their ovular heads, protruding mouths, and deep blue and white stripes. These stripes help them camouflage themselves among the seaweed and coral of their natural environment. They have squat, triangular dorsal fins, lowslung pectoral fins, and broad, strong tails. Their mouths are lined with two rows of small, sharp teeth which they use for grasping and consuming prey. Over a ten-year life cycle, a banded fessle can grow to between 40 and 50 cm long.\nBanded fessles are ambush hunters, preying mainly on smaller fish, macroinvertebrates, and zooplankton. They play an important role in their ecosystem, keeping worms and other creatures from over-grazing on vegetation and disrupting delicate coral reefs. When hunting, a banded fessle floats motionless among local environmental features until a prey animal passes about 5 cm from its hiding spot. It then strikes before its prey is aware of its presence. At around three years of age, a banded fessle will begin to seek out a mate. Banded fessles form lifelong pairs. Each fish will protect the other from threats, assist in hunting, share larger prey, and fend off potential suitors. A banded fessle that has lost its mate sometimes refuses to seek another.\nWhen they are ready to spawn, the pair seek out an appropriate spawning medium, usually a strong seaweed frond or sheltered coral surface. The female then lays a line of eggs and the male fertilizes them. They repeat this process until they have laid up to a thousand eggs. The parents guard their offspring until they learn to hunt on their own. About 1 percent survive to adulthood.\nIn general, banded fessles seldom venture more than 12 meters deep, although they have been recorded at depths of 15 meters when pursuing prey.\nPrized for their pairing behavior and their vibrant, contrasting colors, banded fessles are one of the more popular aquarium fish in the UEE. They number among the marine life that can be raised in tanks alongside fish indigenous to Earth (Sol III). Ideally, they should be kept in warm saltwater, about 24 to 25 degrees Celsius. Because they can grow to be up to 50 cm long, they should only be kept in very large tanks (750 liters or more per fish).\nThe banded fessle is not territorial, but as a carnivore, it can pose a danger to other fish in a shared tank. It is recommended that generous portions of food be provided to fessles so they do not get hungry and turn on their tank mates.\n",
    "Silent Song": "Silent Song is a piece of interactive artwork located in the Tayac system asteroid belt, between Tayac II and Shepherd (Tayac III). The work was commissioned in honor of the Ark's centennial and to highlight xeno-relationships.

    "Banshee System": "The Banshee system, discovered by Adaliz Dayan in 2317, is an unusual planetary system in the United Empire of Earth (UEE), consisting of a pulsar, a mesoplanet, two terrestrial planets, and one ice giant. Its star is not luminous enough for life to develop on the surfaces of any of its planets. However, the third planet from the sun, Lorona, supports an underground settlement populous enough to hold a seat in the UEE Senate. From the 24th to the 26th century, travel to the system was severely restricted by the United Planets of Earth (UPE) until the landmark Minto vs UPE court case that nullified the government's travel ban and ruled that full systems could not be declared off limits.\n",
    "Banu": "The Banu are a spacefaring civilization, the first extrasolar one to ever make contact with Humans. They are capable of quantum travel, traversing jump points, and terraforming planets. Because the Banu do not keep historical records and inhabit multiple celestial bodies in disparate planetary systems, their world of origin is unknown. They are capable of comfortably breathing in a variety of atmospheres and can adapt to a wide range of environments not suitable for Humans. Banu are trained from childhood in a single skill by members of their Souli, a group of non-blood related Banu who live and work together. They maintain open trade relations with all known spacefaring civilizations.\n",
    "Neville Lott": "Neville Lott (2851 - 2917) was a Human serial killer who hunted, captured, dissected, and dismembered seven hikers in the Tecuya Mountains in Vastac, Terra (Terra III) during the 2880s. After losing his twin and parents in the Fall of Caliban in 2884, Lott, heavily burned and injured, was evacuated to Terra. Through his rehabilitation, Lott showed signs of extensive psychological trauma based on the horrific violence he had witnessed during the attack. He disappeared soon after his release from the hospital and was not heard of until several hikers went missing. When captured by Advocacy agents in 2891, they determined that his modus operandi was to seek out potential targets by posing as a hiker and joining people on the trail. He would then return to his potential victim\u2019s campsite at night wearing a mask stitched from a gunny sack, abduct them to his long-term hideout in the mountains, and dissect them alive. Lott refused to seek any kind of insanity plea at his trial and was convicted without presenting a defense. He died in prison in 2917.\nIn her book Unspeakable Evil, Paula Qi presented evidence from childhood associates that Lott exhibited homicidal tendencies before his trauma on Caliban, and has criticized popular dramatizations of his crimes such as 2902 slasher vid The Hill Horror for implying that the events on Caliban turned him into a killer.\n",
    "Banu Cuisine": "Banu Cuisine refers to the common methods by which Banu prepare their food for consumption. Because of the scarcity of records on Banu history due to their cultural practice of not documenting the events of the past, little is known about the origins of their food preparation methods. In addition, their vast trade network, love of experimentation, sensitive palates, and ability to digest almost anything have led Banu to integrate ingredients and cooking techniques from other cultures into their cuisine over time. There are nevertheless distinct traits that are typical of Banu cooking. Most crucial are the melding of many flavors and textures in a dish, the importance placed on utilizing the entirety of each ingredient in a meal, and the taboo on food waste.\nTypically, Banu have one big meal that is eaten alongside other members of their Souli, and then snack throughout the day. The meal is expected to be a show of abundance, with more food than can be eaten in one sitting. Using their hands, each Banu will take food from the display and place it on plates for ease of mixing constituent parts of the meal to personal taste. The meal is then eaten while sitting partially reclined.\nAt the end of a meal, the remaining food is left out, and Banu will come back to it during their work shifts to pick up snacks and maintain their energy. Any food left at the end of the day is then added to the onjussu\u00e6, or \"all-flavor\" stew, a dish that is featured at almost every big meal and is normally eaten as an appetizer. It isn't unusual for a Souli to keep a simmering pot of onjussu\u00e6 that is rarely emptied all the way, and is replenished with liquid and ingredients as needed. If properly maintained, onjussu\u00e6 can be perpetually cooked for decades.\nServing utensils are not common; food that cannot be grasped is scooped with personal plates or cups that individual Banu are expected to bring to the table. These plates often have handles attached and are wide, round, and slightly bowled so that flavors can mingle at the bottom. Banu take pride in using beautifully decorated plates and cups.\nBanu have a very sensitive palate and can detect a wide range of flavors. When filling their plates at the family meal, they seek a balance of what they refer to as biki ndzotayu, or the Nine Tastes: salty, savory, sweet, pungent (acidic/spicy), bitter, hot, cold, soft, and crunchy. The more tastes included in a single bite of a dish, the better it is. One example of this is ofasa, a popular fried treat and staple of Banu food markets. The outside is hot and crunchy, the inside is soft and cool, the ibifissa meat is sweet and salty, and the angafede is bitter and pungent. Having all nine flavors in one bite is seen as efficient and is highly prized.\nBanu do not have a notion of food waste. Whereas Humans will peel an orange before consuming it, Banu will eat the entire thing, savoring the bitter rind as a part of the experience. A Xi'an will discard the hard shell of a klom.e'a, but a Banu diner will leave it on, enjoying the mouthfeel of crunchy chitin breaking apart against soft, sweet flesh. It is seen as extremely inefficient and wasteful not to use the entirety of all ingredients. If any part of an ingredient doesn't work in a particular meal, it is saved for later and used elsewhere.\nThere is a prevailing cultural attitude that things made by expert artisans are superior to anything that can be made by a hobbyist, and this includes meals. Outside of the maintenance of the pot of onjussu\u00e6, there is a strong preference among Soulis to procure ready-made or easily reheatable meals and snacks from Food Soulis, which specialize in making a handful of dishes designed to produce maximum flavor efficiency and very little waste. These meals are either delivered or picked up at large markets.\nSome Soulis have been known to indenture Banu from recently-dissolved Food Soulis to keep everyone fed. Larger Soulis will typically form partnerships with Food Soulis to keep all their members fed, whereas small Soulis will have their members procure food on a rotating basis and contribute to the pantry. It is considered a caring gesture for Banu to pick up a treat for their fellow Souli members and add it to the pantry. Essosouli are expected to provide their members with especially nice food from time to time, particularly if it has been sourced from distant locations.\nDining out is very popular among Banu. Eating Soulis operate public dining halls where they prepare and serve freshly-made food, generally buffet-style. Members of Soulis that have signed long-term contracts with Eating Soilis are among their most common guests, but most will welcome individual paying customers as well. Just as Banu bring their own plates to their meals at home, they are expected to do this at Eating Soulis. Those who come to an Eating Souli without a plate can often purchase one from a nearby Dishware Souli. Rarely, an Eating Souli will keep emergency plates in stock, but having to use one is seen as uncouth.\n",

Upon adulthood, a successful Indentured Apprentice will be granted full membership in their Souli. Adults in the Banu Protectorate may sell themselves into Indenture to pay off a debt, learn a new skill, or for a variety of other reasons. Prisoners can also be sold to Indenture Soulis for a profit.\n",
    "Banu Language": "Banu language refers to a family of languages originating with and spoken by the Banu. Though all Banu share the same writing system, they speak many dialects, some of which are not mutually intelligible. Xenolinguists believe that this is partially due to their lack of both a central homeworld and a centralized government. The Banu have no formal name for their languages; instead, one who speaks Banu would say they \u201cspeak like Banu-folk\u201d (yufu zuBanu, or yufu zo uBanu).\n",

    "Nexus II": "Nexus II is the second planet from the sun of the Nexus system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). A world with a dense, nitrogen-rich atmosphere, it was used by the then-United Nations of Earth (UNE) as a testing ground to develop new terraforming technology to use on smog planets. The UNE's failure to achieve this goal is partially what led to its decision to sell exclusive mining rights to the Hathor Group.\n",
    "Nexus III": "Nexus III is a naturally habitable terrestrial planet in the Nexus system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Once the central hub of the Hathor Group, former owners of exclusive mining rights to Nexus, the planet was inhabited by squatters and outlaws when the company abandoned the system in 2672. It remained a stronghold for smugglers, pirates, and others until 2931, when the UEE Navy launched an operation to retake the system and established a forward operating base on Nexus III.

    "Nexus System": "The Nexus system is a planetary system in the United Empire of Earth (UEE) that consists of one protoplanet, three terrestrial planets, a gas giant, an asteroid belt, and an A-type main sequence star. Discovered in 2445 by United Nations of Earth Navy (UNEN) pilot Dominic Thapa, its existence was initially kept secret from the public due to its only known jump point connection to Cathcart, which was a restricted military system at the time. After terraforming Nexus IV, the UNE suffered a budget shortfall and were unable to continue development of the system. As a solution, the mining rights to Nexus were sold to the Hathor Group in 2468. After the company strip mined a large portion of the system and extracted all they could, they left in 2672. Over the course of the next several decades, outlaws took control of much of the abandoned infrastructure and began using the planet Lagos (Nexus III) as a base of operations.

He was also the first Human to visit a planetary system beyond Sol, which would eventually be named in his honor (Croshaw). Croshaw spent years studying the Neso Triangle, a sector near Neptune (Sol VIII) where spacecraft would vanish without trace or explanation. His findings led him to believe that a previously undiscovered type of astral anomaly was responsible for the disappearances. By utilizing a personally modified quantum drive, he was able to embark on a solo mission to traverse through the anomaly and \u201cjump\u201d to another solar system. Croshaw\u2019s successful navigation of the first Human-discovered jump point ushered in a new age of exploration and colonization for Humans.\n",

They joined the UEE Navy in 2782, where they repaired damaged spacecraft aboard multiple capital-class starships. While on shore leave in the Goss system, Traeger opted out of enjoying the beach and instead worked on a broken scanner. When they went out to test it, they at first thought that their repairs had failed until they traced the strange signal and discovered a previously-unknown jump point. Traeger accepted an honorable discharge in 2808, after which they used the reward money from their discovery to open a ship repair shop on Cassel (Goss II).\n",
    "Noble (Ellis V)": "Noble (Ellis V) is a heavily forested planet in the Ellis system, United Empire of Earth (UEE), and is one of three habitable planets in the system. In the early days after its terraforming, colonists established settlements and harvested resources as needed with little regard to preserving the natural environment. When visitors from the nearby planets Kampos (Ellis IV) and Green (Ellis III) began visiting Noble to enjoy its pristine landscapes, bringing a great deal of income with them, the Governors Council voted to roll back its urban development plans and instead focus on the creation of a tourist industry.\n",
    "Noble Ammunition": "Noble Ammunition is a Human manufacturer of munitions. Their primary market is the production of small arms ammunition, though they maintain several factories devoted to larger caliber ballistics.

The youngest daughter of one of House Ruoth's Matriarchs, she was expected to follow in the footsteps of her family and become a political historian. However, she found she preferred exploration and spacecraft piloting. During her time in the P\u014d't.\u014dngp.\u016b, she served as a scout for the Xi'an military, and would explore the outskirts of whatever system in which she was posted during her breaks. This hobby led her to discover a previously-unknown jump point from the R.il'a system to the United Planets of Earth (UPE)-controlled Gurzil system, then named Odara. Her appearance in Odara caused an increase in tensions between the Xi'an Empire and the UPE, so while she was commended for her discovery, she was reprimanded for her carelessness in entering the jump point and stripped of her duty as a pilot. She served the remainder of her time in the P\u014d\u2019t.\u014dngp.\u016b as a file clerk. After returning to her House, she took up the family business but obtained her own ship and continued flying whenever she could. She won the Koa e Ko'ia in III.1112 (SEY 2881).\n",
    "Banu Religion": "Banu Religion is made up of a wide variety of beliefs concerning rituals and the cultivation of good luck. Generally, the Banu focus less on the soul or the afterlife and more on a feeling that if something exists beyond the physical world that it should be on your side and working in your favor. It is therefore not uncommon for Banu to adopt gods from religions they encounter during the course of their lives. Cassa, the Patron of Luck, and Taernin, the Great Traveler, feature strong followings.\n",

Most import and export traffic on Noble passes through Bareton, making it a noisy and busy place in spite of its scenic surroundings.\n",
    "Oberon III": "Oberon III is a protoplanet that orbits third from the star of the unclaimed Oberon system. Alongside its sister protoplanet Oberon IV, it is theorized that it formed in the Oberon system after its original star went supernova and collapsed into a neutron star. However, it failed to gain enough mass from the dust and gas of the newly-formed accretion disk to become a full planet.\n",
    "Basilisk": "Basilisk is a Human personal and spacecraft armor manufacturer headquartered on Cascom (Castra II). Founded in the first half of the 2500s to research new armor composites, Basilisk received the bulk of its initial funding from the United Empire of Earth (UEE) until the end of the Messer Era in 2792. In the aftermath, their budget was significantly reduced during the governmental reorganization, so they opened their products to the civilian market.\n",
    "Oberon IV": "Oberon IV is a protoplanet in the unclaimed Oberon system, and is the fourth planet from its star. Like its sister protoplanet Oberon III, it is theorized to have formed after the original star of the system went supernova.

    "Battle of Centauri": "The Battle of Centauri was an armed military engagement between the Tevarin and the United Empire of Earth (UEE) and was the final battle of the Second Tevarin War (2603 - 2610). On 24 June 2610, the Tevarin Warlord Corath'thal and his forces entered the Centauri system with the Centauri-Elysium jump point as their goal, around which the UEE Navy (UEEN) had placed a blockade. Instead of charging for the jump point, Corath'thal's fleet diverted for Yar and Saisei, forcing the UEEN to break its formation and defend the populace leaving a small contingent of ships behind to protect the jump point. Captain Alexandra Dunlevy of the UEEN's 42nd Squadron, believing that this strategy would fail, convinced her commanding officer Admiral Tibault Fraser of the UEES Countenance to pretend to retreat under fire from the approaching Tevarin forces. As Corath'thal's fleet broke formation to enter the jump point, the 42nd Squadron ambushed them and took out their shields, giving the UEEN the opportunity to destroy a majority of the Tevarin ships. While Corath'thal and his remaining forces did manage to break the line and enter the Elysium system, they lacked the numbers to retake it. Instead, they chose to immolate themselves in the atmosphere of their former homeworld, bringing the Second Tevarin War to an end.\n",
    "Oberon System": "The Oberon system is an unclaimed planetary system discovered in 2356 that consists of a neutron star, a super-Earth, a terrestrial planet, two protoplanets, a mesoplanet, a gas dwarf, and a gas giant. In spite of its dangerous, dim star and multiple connections to Vanduul-occupied systems, there are majority-Human settlements on Gonn (Oberon I) and Uriel (Oberon II). Because the neutron star at the system's center makes above-ground colonization profoundly dangerous, nearly all homesteads in Oberon are located underground. In 2946, the United Empire of Earth Navy (UEEN) received intelligence that a Vanduul Clan was preparing to launch an invasion of the Oberon system. Under the orders of Admiral Ernst Bishop, the UEES Retribution ambushed and destroyed the Clan as it entered the system. Since then, the UEEN has maintained a presence in Oberon in case of future Vanduul attacks.\n",
    "Battle of Idris IV": "The Battle of Idris IV was a major engagement during the First Tevarin War (2541-2546) between Human forces of the United Planets of Earth (UPE) and the Tevarin. It took place on 1 October 2544 on and above Idris IV. Before the battle, the UPE had been losing ground, resulting in the planet being overtaken by Tevarin forces. The tactics of a young Ivar Messer ensured UPE victory at Idris IV and turned the tide of the war. This battle was key in beginning Messer's rise to power. A monument to the battle has been established on Idris IV.\n",
    "Oberon V": "Oberon V is a mesoplanet in the unclaimed Oberon system, and is the fifth planet from its star. Small and dense, Oberon V has a thin atmosphere of nitrogen and carbon dioxide, and has a mantle of mixed methane and water ice.

    "Battle of Koren Pass": "The Battle of Koren Pass was a military engagement between the United Empire of Earth (UEE) and the Tevarin in 2605. It took place on Crion (Caliban II), when a group of UEE Army soldiers traveling in Nova tanks were besieged by a Tevarin strike team. The battle lasted sixteen straight hours, without rest. It ended with a UEE victory when rescue forces arrived and forced a Tevarin retreat.\n",
    "Oberon VI": "Oberon VI is a gas dwarf that orbits sixth from the neutron star of the unclaimed Oberon system. Its white, blue, and pale-pink banded atmosphere of hydrogen and helium hides a rocky core covered with ammonia and water ice. Conditions deep within the planet are too high-pressure to allow for a ship to land, but the abundant hydrogen in its upper reaches has made Oberon VI a common refueling spot.\n",
    "Battle of Orion": "The Battle of Orion was a massed engagement between the United Empire of Earth (UEE) and the Vanduul that began on 16 February 2712, when thousands of Vanduul accompanied by a Kingship poured into Orion from a previously unknown jump point to the system later coded VS-09 \"Vulture.\" The battle marked the first time UEE forces encountered a Kingship. On 18 February, the UEE was forced to cede the Orion system to the invading Vanduul forces. This was the first major defeat for the UEE since the temporary loss of the Idris system in 2542. It is considered by military historians to be a turning point in the ongoing conflict between the UEE and the Vanduul.\n",
    "Oberon VII": "Oberon VII is a gas giant that orbits the neutron star of the unclaimed Oberon system. Considered by locals to be the only calming sight in the system, Oberon VII has a muted light blue-gray atmosphere that lacks global cloud cover. In 2939, Uriel (Oberon II) resident Ruqayyah Shelton attempted to establish a ship-based retreat that would orbit Oberon VII and use the planet as a backdrop during meditation sessions. After three years, Shelton was forced to shutter his business due to multiple attacks from outlaw gangs.\n",
    "Battle of Vega II": "The Battle of Vega II was fought on 5 October 2945 between the United Empire of Earth and the Vanduul. It was sparked when a large Vanduul Clan led by a Kingship jumped to the Vega system and attacked the planet Aremis (Vega II). After a desperate battle against overwhelming forces, the United Empire of Earth Navy's (UEEN) 2nd Fleet commanded by Admiral Ernst Bishop managed to turn the tide with the destruction of the kingship that drove the Vanduul survivors out of the system. The attack elevated concern about the Vanduul threat and led to a military action to reclaim Human systems lost to the Vanduul. This marked the first time in history that Human forces destroyed a Vanduul Kingship.\n",
    "Odin II": "Odin II is the planet closest to the Odin system's star, United Empire of Earth (UEE).

Human manufacturer Esperia has partnered with the UEEN to produce replica Blade spacecraft for aggressor training operations and for sale on the civilian market.\n",
    "Bloom (Pyro III)": "Bloom (Pyro III) is the third planet from the sun of the Pyro system. Cold but naturally habitable, it became the epicenter of mining endeavors in Pyro. Pyrotechnic Amalgamated and other corporations constructed multiple staging sites, employees barracks, and processing centers that were in use until the cost of their maintenance could no longer be offset by mining profits. Abandoned when the last active corporations in Pyro ceased operations there in the late 26th century, they were claimed by squatters, outlaws, and former miners who lacked the means to return to the United Empire of Earth (UEE).\n",
    "Blue Bilva": "The blue bilva (or blubee) is a rich, sugary, and aromatic tree fruit that originated on Reisse (Rhetor III). Fibrous in its natural state, the vivid turquoise flesh of the fruit clings to a large black stone that is so hard it must be cracked through mechanical means. Some artisans on Reisse use powered tools to carve the stone into intricate sculptures that they sell to new students for good luck. Blue bilva forms the base of the locally popular brandy B3.\n",
    "Bombora (Ellis X)": "Bombora (Ellis X) is a gas giant with a stormy atmosphere in the Ellis system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Hydrogen and helium are abundant on Bombora, but due to its turbulent winds, harvesting resources from it is a challenging affair. It was nicknamed bombora after a Human term for a dangerous stretch of water.\n",
    "Borea (Magnus II)": "Borea is the second planet from the sun in the Magnus system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Terraforming began on the planet shortly after the system was discovered in 2499. Until 2631, it was the center of shipbuilding operations for the United Empire of Earth Navy (UEEN), and enjoyed a thriving economy. Newcastle, the capital, was renowned for the quality of ship components produced by its artisans and businesses. However, when the shipbuilding industry shuttered after the Navy's move to Kilian, the planet's fortunes sharply degraded. Many buildings were abandoned as the population sought jobs on other worlds. In recent decades, commercial spacecraft industries such as Drake Interplanetary have purchased the old warehouses and shipyards in Odyssa that were abandoned by the UEEN, bringing much-needed jobs with them. For the first time since the mid-27th century, its population is rising.\n",
    "Boreal Stalker": "The boreal stalker is an apex predator found on microTech (Stanton IV) and created by the company microTech to help round out their planet's ecosystem. After the error in the terraforming process that led to a climate far colder than had been intended, many of the plants and animals the United Empire of Earth (UEE) government used to stock the planet died. After purchasing the planet from the UEE, microTech opted to artificially engineer plants and animals to fill empty ecological niches, including the boreal stalker.\n",
    "Branaugh Belt Alpha": "The Branaugh belt alpha is an asteroid belt in the Branaugh system. Residents of the system operate various independent mines on the asteroids to keep their settlements supplied with goods to trade. In addition to the mines, some Tevarin who prefer to live in isolation outside of the community on Branaugh II reside on the larger asteroids. Each year, several spacecraft are reported missing while traveling the belt. Although the ships' disappearances have never been directly linked to the asteroid inhabitants, locals use caution while flying in the area.\n",
    "Branaugh I": "Branaugh I is a terrestrial planet in the Branaugh system. Mostly covered in lava rock from ancient volcanic eruptions, the planet has a black surface interspersed with cracks of gray and brown. Because of its dark color, it reflects very little light and is difficult to see with the naked eye unless it is viewed in transit across its sun. It completes its orbit around Branaugh in around 22 Standard Earth Days.\n",
    "Branaugh II": "Branaugh II is the second planet from the sun of the Branaugh system. Uncommonly among terrestrial worlds of its size, it has a wide set of rings that are visible from its surface. Surveyors initially thought the beautiful rings might attract people to Branaugh II, but upon further inspection, concluded that the stormy planet was not a good candidate for terraformation. In the early 2900s, a small group of Tevarin who no longer wished to live in the United Empire of Earth (UEE) repurposed the outposts and structures that the surveyors left behind as dwellings. As more settlers arrived, the settlement expanded into a town. Today, Branaugh II is home to a large community of Tevarin in spite of the planet's unfriendly atmosphere.\n",
    "Branaugh III": "Branaugh III is a gas giant in the Branaugh system. Due to the presence of ammonia crystals, it is pale yellow in color with bands of light-yellow green and grayish-blue. Violent storms erupt on Branaugh III when water vapor trapped in the upper atmosphere undergoes cooling, then rapidly breaks through the layers of hydrogen and helium that comprise most of the planet's atmosphere. In 2911, the largest storm ever recorded on Branaugh III encircled the entire planet.\n",
    "Branaugh System": "The Branaugh system is an unclaimed planetary system that consists of a K-type main sequence star, two terrestrial planets, one gas giant, and an asteroid belt. Although it was officially discovered by mining surveyor Desmond Fell in 2877, he was not the first Human to visit the system. During Fell's initial surveys, he located the crashed ship and the body of explorer Theresa Branaugh, who had gone missing four years prior. The UEE ultimately chose not to claim the system after the Senate Subcommittee on Expansion delivered an analysis that showed that the potential resources gleaned from the system would barely offset the cost of development. Since then, an enclave of Tevarin expatriates has developed on Branaugh II, despite its unfriendly atmosphere.\n",
    "Bremen I": "Bremen I is the first planet from the sun of the Bremen system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). A protoplanet, it has a differentiated interior, but somewhat misshapen surface. A superstition originating on Rytif (Bremen II) credits Bremen I with granting pilots good luck when they tip the wings of their spacecraft towards the planet.\n",
    "Bremen III": "Bremen III is the third planet from the sun of the Bremen system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). A coreless planet, its undifferentiated interior was once rich in natural resources. Extensive mining activity since its discovery in 2441 has depleted Bremen III of nearly all its large valuable mineral deposits. Many smaller veins remain, but all the major mining companies previously located on Bremen III pulled out when the price of continuing their operations outweighed potential profits.\n",
    "Bremen IV": "Bremen is the fourth planet from the sun of the Bremen system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). An ice giant, it is largely made up of hydrogen; however, violent weather conditions on the planet create inhospitable conditions for harvesting gas. The people of Rytif (Bremen II) consider Bremen IV to be the guardian of the system, thanks to an incident in 2591 when a dangerously large comet on a trajectory towards Rytif instead was caught in Bremen IV's gravity, saving Rytif from a potentially deadly impact.\n",
    "Bremen System": "The Bremen system is a planetary system in the United Empire of Earth (UEE), consisting of a K-type main sequence star, one protoplanet, two terrestrial planets, and one ice giant. Discovered by explorer Bao Yun in 2441 during the Human Colonial Expansion Era (2380 - 2530), the system saw slow development until the Second Tevarin War (2603 - 2610). The demand for military rations caused a population boom as much of Rytif (Bremen II) was turned into a center of food production. After the war, immigration to the system sharply fell, and the population eventually returned to its pre-war level. Bremen came to prominence again in 2792, when it was revealed that anti-Messer revolutionaries had been using the system as a base of operations.\n",
    "Bruder (Chronos I)": "Bruder is the first planet from the sun in the Chronos system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). A mesoplanet, it orbits close enough to the system's sun that landing on the surface without adequate thermal shielding is dangerous. While long-distance scans indicate that valuable resources exist in Bruder's crust, the temperature is too high to justify long-term mining operations.\n",
    "Buccaneer": "The Buccaneer is a civilian medium fighter sold by Drake Interplanetary. It was initially designed as an affordable option for frontier militia squadrons conscious of limited repair and maintenance opportunities. The Buccaneer is offered alongside Drake's Cutlass/Caterpillar system and has become a popular design among explorers and pirates.\n",
    "Buoy": "A buoy is an object positioned at a stationary point in space. Buoys are most frequently used to mark specific points of interest in space either to warn spacecraft of a particular danger, like an asteroid field, or to support navigation towards difficult-to-detect spaces like shipping lanes or jump points. Buoys are also used to transmit communications and to provide early warning to military and police organizations.\n",
    "C2 Hercules": "The C2 Hercules is an armed transport spacecraft developed by Crusader Industries. Built with a military-grade frame, the C2 Hercules includes turrets and ballistic canons, as well as a large shielding system. Its hold can be transformed into a dedicated cargo space large enough to store other spacecraft and ground vehicles. Private organizations such as touring or entertainment companies utilize the C2 Hercules as passenger transports.\n",
    "C8 Pisces": "The C8 Pisces is a scouting spacecraft manufactured by Anvil Aerospace as a landing craft for the Carrack. It is not available for standalone purchase. While it can be utilized as a reconnaissance, exploration, or landing ship by a single pilot, it is capable of transporting two additional passengers. The cargo hold can be used to transport cargo and supplies from the surface of a planet to a Carrack in orbit. An expedition version of the ship, the C8X, is equipped with additional firepower and can be purchased as a standalone.\n",
    "Caldera": "Caldera is a Human personal armor company that sells high-tech spacesuits and exploration gear designed to withstand harsh environmental conditions. Most of their products are built with internal communications devices and scanners for use in remote or unexplored locations. While their suits are not combat armor, they do come with defensive capabilities.\n",
    "Calliope (Stanton 4a)": "Calliope is a cold, windy moon of microTech (Stanton IV), named after the mythical muse of epic poetry and eloquence from ancient Earth (Sol III). Due to the high winds and extreme cold, weather suits worn by visitors to the planet are known to fail, particularly on the moon's dark side. Shubin Interstellar operates a number of processing facilities on Calliope.\n",
    "Candle Road": "Candle Road was a Human settlement on Crion (Caliban II) and was the de facto headquarters of the Crion Security Legion. Initially established in 2510 as a military airfield, it did not rise to prominence until the mid-29th century when it became a major support facility for efforts to terraform Caliban III. Candle Road was destroyed by aerial bombardment in 2884 during the final phase of the Vanduul invasion of the Caliban System.\n",
    "Cano Belt Alpha": "The Cano belt alpha is an asteroid belt that orbits the sun in the Cano system between Cano III and Pox (Cano IV), United Empire of Earth (UEE). While it was mined extensively in the past, activity has slowed since the Fair Chance Act was applied to Carteyna (Cano II) in the late 2800s.\n",
    "Cano I": "Cano I is a mesoplanet in the Cano system, United Empire of Earth (UEE), and is tidally locked to its sun. Abundant lava flows have caused crystalline structures to form along the solar terminator. While the formations cannot be easily visited due to Cano I's proximity to its star, they are large enough to be seen from space.\n",
    "Cano III": "Cano III is a smog planet in the Cano system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). While it is located within the system's green band, its dense, thick atmosphere has made terraforming impossible. Geohacking corporations that once operated on Carteyna (Cano II) have been granted permission from the UEE government to use Cano III as a testbed for new technology.\n",
    "Cano System": "The Cano system is a planetary system in the United Empire of Earth (UEE), discovered in 2463 by Tabatha Caster and Jamel Normond during Project Far Star. It consists of a G-type main sequence star, a mesoplanet, two terrestrial planets, an asteroid belt, and a gas giant. Though none of the planets in the system have been successfully terraformed, Carteyna (Cano II) supports a small population of Humans in sealed arcologies under the northern ice cap.\n",
    "Carrack": "The Carrack is a long-term exploration spacecraft developed by Anvil Aerospace for the United Empire of Earth Navy (UEEN). Once only used by the military, it is now sold on the civilian market. The Carrack is capable of making planetfall in hostile environments and deploying smaller exploration vehicles in support of its mission. It is equipped with specialized sensors for pathfinding, medical and repair facilities, and reinforced fuel tanks for long-duration flight. Each Carrack comes with a C8 Pisces snub scout ship.\n",
    "Carteyna (Cano II)": "Carteyna is the second planet from the star of the Cano system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). An ocean world discovered in 2463, Carteyna has resisted terraforming attempts. Its residents inhabit sealed arcologies surrounded by geothermal waters underneath the planet's northern ice cap. The Fair Chance Act was invoked to prevent further terraforming attempts when microscopic organisms exhibiting signs of intelligence were discovered in the ocean. While immigration is prohibited, the descendants of Carteyna's original settlers have been allowed to stay in Carteyna City.\n",
    "Carteyna City": "Carteyna City is the only city on Carteyna (Cano II), United Empire of Earth (UEE). Located in an underwater arcology below the planet's polar ice cap, Carteyna City is a wonder of Human engineering, and is able to draw energy from geothermal vents located fathoms down. Many of its inhabitants are either active researchers engaged in observing the nascent sentient life developing among Carteyna's microorganisms, or are descendants of the planet's original settlers.\n",
    "Cascom (Castra II)": "Cascom is an inhabited planet in the Castra system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). It was originally terraformed as a military-only planet in the late 2500s, and operated as a UEE naval base until 2789, when it was opened for civilian settlement. Cascom remained lightly populated until the 2830s, when a successful promotional campaign offering incentives attracted a new influx of immigrants. Its capital, Sherman, is home to many retirees brought there by the city's views and low-priced real estate.\n",
    "Cassa, the Patron of Luck": "Cassa, the Patron of Luck, is the Banu god of fortune, prosperity, money, and merchants. Although its origins are unknown, it is one of the most common deities in the Banu pantheon for its governance over success in business. Religious Soulis that represent Cassa travel from Souli to Souli, collecting offerings and prayer commissions from Banu seeking good fortune in trade. Because it is so commonly seen on altars throughout the Banu Protectorate, xenoanthropologists speculate that it may be one of the oldest Banu gods still worshiped.\n",
    "Casse Aerospace": "Casse Aerospace was a spacecraft manufacturer that operated from 2599 to 2623. Founded by noted ship designer and former Roberts Space Industries (RSI) engineer Leonard Casse, it released its first ship in 2604, the limited-run Cosmo Sloop. Due to the ongoing Second Tevarin War (2603 - 2610), the leisure craft's sales were lower than projected, and Casse made the decision to pivot his designs from civilian to military. The 2607 Hurricane fighter saw success in the latter years of the war. After the conflict ended, the company accepted a contract from the United Empire of Earth (UEE) government to create a long-range patrol ship, but all work ceased when Casse passed away in 2615 after an in-air collision. The board sold the company to an investment firm in 2620, and closed its doors. In 2784, J. Harris Arnold of Anvil Aerospace purchased Casse Aerospace's portfolio in response to a copyright infringement lawsuit for allegedly stealing elements of Casse's designs. Today, Anvil utilizes Casse's signature elements of curved wings and an open circle signet in many of its ships.\n",
    "Cassel (Goss II)": "Cassel (Goss II) is the second planet from the binary suns of the Goss system in the United Empire of Earth (UEE). An ocean world with many islands and small continents, Cassel was colonized in the early 2500s. The natural beauty of turquoise, gold, and deep orange bands in the sky alongside the planet's coastlines and forests have made it a major tourist destination. Exports from Cassel are strictly regulated. The planet is currently recognized and has one seat in the UEE Senate.\n",
    "Castor (Corel IV)": "Castor (Corel IV) is a terrestrial, desert planet that sits at the far outer edge of the Corel system's green band, in the United Empire of Earth (UEE). In 2651, Corsen Messer V ordered several companies to terraform the planet, so it could serve as an example of the capacity of Human technology. Though it was technically terraformed, the atmosphere is thin and the climate is almost intolerably cold. A handful of settlements dot Castor, primarily centered around deep ice-mining operations.\n",
    "Castra I": "Castra I is a coreless planet in the Castra system, United Empire of Earth (UEE)). Too close to the sun to be terraformed for Human habitation, the UEE Navy used Castra I for target practice and weapons testing throughout the Messer Era (SEY 2546 - 2792), leaving it covered in craters. The swathes of glass left on the surface after centuries of weapon impacts will sometimes catch the light and make the planet appear to glitter.\n",
    "Castra System": "Castra is a planetary system in the United Empire of Earth (UEE). Discovered in SEY 2544, it was originally designated as a military staging area due to its jump point connection with the Oya system in the former Perry Line. At the end of the Messer Era (2546 - 2792), the system was opened up to non-military settlement and has since become a center of trade and tourism. The second planet from its sun, Cascom (Castra II), is expected to apply for representation in the UEE Senate in the near future.\n",
    "Caterpillar": "The Caterpillar is a multi-crew utility spacecraft and armored freighter manufactured by Drake Interplanetary. Designed for storage, it can be adapted to suit the needs of multiple types of cargo. It can also can be used for combat roles, such as a raiding command center or a q-ship. Drake sells the Caterpillar as the flagship of its spacecraft system, which includes the Cutlass, Dragonfly, and Buccaneer.\n",
    "Cathcart Belt Alpha": "The Cathcart belt alpha is a wide asteroid belt in the Cathcart system. Located in the system's green band, it lacks any celestial bodies large enough to support the kind of atmosphere that would give rise to life. Astrophysicists believe that these asteroids grew from what little matter was left in Cathcart after the formation of its massive star.\n",
    "CC's Conversions": "CC's Conversions is a Human personal armor customization and resale company. In addition to creating bespoke pieces, CC's purchases discounted stock from other vendors and converts it into limited edition sets. They do not repeat runs once they are completely sold.\n",
    "Centauri Belt Alpha": "The Centauri belt alpha is an asteroid belt in the Centauri system, United Empire of Earth (UEE), that orbits the system's sun between Centauri IV and Centauri V. A dense belt with enough mass to form a planet, the heavy metals and other resources that can be found there are extracted to support various industries on Saisei (Centauri III). Due to the abundance of resources, major mining conglomerates, independent businesses, and sole prospectors are able to work alongside one another with little competition.\n",
    "Centauri I": "Centauri I is a protoplanet in the Centauri system, United Empire of Earth (UEE) that orbits very close to its sun. Surveyor Kelly Alden captured an image of Centauri I in 2639 through her ship's camera, capturing the protoplanet in the path of a blue-white prominence that seems to reach out and grasp it. A copy of the photograph hangs in the Centauri Museum of Fine Art.\n",
    "Centauri IV": "Centauri IV is the fourth planet from the sun in the Centauri system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). A coreless world, it lacks an electromagnetic field, and experiences no volcanic activity. Its surface is heavily scarred from crater impacts, likely from the nearby asteroid belt. Although it exists outside Centauri's green band, multiple terraforming companies have considered attempting to install an atmosphere on Centauri IV to facilitate easier access to the planet's mineral deposits.\n",
    "Cathcart System": "The Cathcart system is an unclaimed planetary system that consists of a class A main sequence star and an asteroid belt. Discovered in 2438 by Human fugitive Adelaide Lorris, who named the system after the Marshal who had been pursuing her, it was not claimed by the United Nations of Earth (UNE) due to its lack of planets. Instead, the military utilized it as a junkyard for outdated and damaged spacecraft and space stations. It wasn't long before outlaws and drifters began to claim the abandoned vessels, lashed the salvaged hulls together, and retrofitted them with atmospheric systems. By the 2700s, this mass of interconnected ships became the system's largest settlement, a sprawling network of repurposed space junk nicknamed \"Spider.\"\n",
    "Cellin (Stanton 2a)": "Cellin is a volcanically active moon thronged with geysers that orbits Crusader (Stanton II), and is the planet's closest natural satellite. Its tenuous atmosphere contains trace amounts of oxygen, but not enough to support respiration. In spite of the toxic air, many residences and outposts have been established on Cellin since Phillip Xu constructed the first permanent homestead in 2906. The moon was named after the character Cellin from the popular Human children's story A Gift for Baba.\n",
    "CenterMass": "CenterMass is a Human spacecraft weapons and armor retailer with franchise stores in multiple locations across the United Empire of Earth (UEE). Founded as a weapons-only store, they added armor to their inventory in 2939. They also keep mechanics on staff for installation, modification, and repair of any items purchased at a CenterMass store.\n",
    "Centralist Party": "The Centralist party is a Human political party; one of the three largest political parties in the United Empire of Earth (UEE). Members of the Centralist party typically favor government regulation and spending, lower taxes, and increased privacy laws, and vote against military spending. They also take a hard-line stance against moving the capital of the UEE away from Earth. The most recent Centralist Imperator of the UEE was Mikkel Sheriden, who served from 2931 to 2941.\n",
    "Centurion": "The Centurion is a short-range anti-aircraft ground vehicle manufactured by Anvil Aerospace. Like the Ballista and the Spartan, it is built on the Atlas Platform. Intended to work in tandem with longer-range vehicles, the Centurion was designed as a mobile perimeter defense system able to operate in a variety of environments. It comes with a turret with a gunner's seat and a remote turret controlled by the driver, and features a thick armored hull.\n",
    "Ceprozin": "Ceprozin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug invented by Rayari Inc in 2938 at the Hickes Research Outpost on the moon Cellin (Stanton 2a) in the Stanton system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). A product of decades of research and development, Ceprozin provides pain relief and curbs inflammation without any of the side effects common with other NSAIDs, such as stomach and kidney problems. It is widely used during cybernetic replacement surgeries.\n",
    "Cestulus (Davien II)": "Cestulus is the second planet in the Davien system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Despite being initially considered a poor candidate for terraforming, Cestulus became a major shipping hub after first contact with the Banu in SEY 2438. The city of Jata was the site of a series of bombings in 2546. The bombings, known as the Atrocity at Jata, were one of the catalysts that led the United Planets of Earth (UPE) to adopt Ivar Messer'sPrime Citizen plan. After the end of the Messer Era (2546 - 2792), historian Sydney Kamarck uncovered evidence that linked the attack to Messer allies Adam Corr and Cyrus Ishitaka, allegedly to facilitate Messer's political ascent.\n",
    "Char": "Char is a former surveying station on Cole (Nul III) in the Nul system. Constructed in 2493 by Behesht Mines, the facility was abandoned in 2614 after the costs of operating it exceeded the profits the company earned from mining the planet's resources. In the mid-2600s, people looking to conduct business outside of legal oversight began to use the station as a meeting place. Over the years, it has grown into a thriving marketplace that offers an eclectic variety of goods, some of which are illegal in certain jurisdictions.\n",
    "Charon 2a": "Charon 2a is the innermost moon of Charon II, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Unusually for a moon of its small size, it has a thin atmosphere generated by high volcanic and seismic activity. An independent band of mercenaries attempted to establish a base on Charon 2a in the late 2800s, but were forced to abandon it after it was destroyed in a powerful series of earthquakes.\n",
    "Charon 2b": "Charon 2b is the outermost moon of Charon II, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Though it is desolate today, systems of channels and caves on its surface suggest that liquid water once flowed there. The majority of caves on Charon 2b have yet to be fully charted.\n",
    "Charon I": "Charon I is the first planet from the sun in the Charon system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). At some point in the distant past, the planet was likely knocked from its orbit by a rogue body. Its surface is sublimating as it falls towards the sun, giving the planet the appearance of an unusually massive comet.\n",
    "Charon II": "Charon II is a smog planet in the Charon system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Positioned just inside the green band, its surface temperature and high-pressure atmosphere make landing on the planet dangerous. Carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide are the two most prevalent gasses on the planet, causing a runaway greenhouse effect.\n",
    "Charon III": "Charon III (formerly Haros) is an inhabited planet in the Charon system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). During the Messer Era (SEY 2546 - 2792), the planet was used as a site for vast prisons and re-education camps. After the fall of the Messers in 2792, the populace stormed the detention facilities and freed the prisoners. Once the extent of the deplorable conditions and practices came to light, it inspired a vote to renounce Haros' recognition by the UEE. Today, Charon III remains an unrecognized planet. Two of its states, Dellin and Acheron, began armed conflict with one another following the election of Tarquin Klast as Dellin's governor in 2944. The UEE military has been monitoring the civil war, but has avoided direct interference.\n",
    "Charon System": "The Charon system is a planetary system in the United Empire of Earth (UEE). Discovered in SEY 2538, it was used as a prison system during the Messer Era (2546 - 2792), with most prisons concentrated in the state of Dellin on Haros (Charon III). After the assassination of Linton Messer XI in 2792, the non-incarcerated population of Charon III stormed the prisons seeking to free political dissidents being held there. Once the public gained access to the site, the many atrocities performed by the administrators of the prison on behalf of the Messer government were confirmed. These revelations pushed the planet\u2019s senators to renounce their recognition from the UEE. To this day, the Governors Council of Charon III has not sought re-recognition from the Senate.\n",
    "Charon V": "Charon V is a dwarf planet in the Charon system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Numerous planetary surveys done since the system was discovered have confirmed that there are not enough precious mineral resources to justify the installation of permanent mining operations here. Some independent miners operate outposts on Charon V, away from possible business interference from large conglomerates.\n",
    "Centauri System": "The Centauri system is a planetary system in the United Empire of Earth (UEE), made up of an A-type main sequence star, a protoplanet, three terrestrial planets, an asteroid belt, and a super-Jupiter gas giant. Discovered in 2365, two of its planets have been terraformed for Human habitation. Yar (Centauri II) is a largely desert world, sparsely populated and beset by dust storms. Saisei (Centauri III) is a carefully constructed, highly populated world built to harmonize with the natural environment.\n",
    "Centauri V": "Centauri V is a red and yellow super-Jupiter in the Centauri system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Enormous, violent storms that almost encircle the entire planet occasionally develop near the equator, while its north and south poles are encircled by systems of permanent cyclones. Spacecraft sometimes utilize the upper atmosphere of Centauri V for refueling, barring the presence of any extreme weather.\n",
    "Centennial Bloom (Pui'arai.ly'ii)": "The centennial bloom (pui'arai.ly'ii) is a plant indigenous to Ko'li (\u0112'aluth III) that flowers once every 100 Modern Xi'an Years (MXY). Many centennial blooms are tended on R.aip'u\u0101ng (Kai'pua II), the center of Li\u2019tova in the Xi'an Empire (SaoXy'an). Like the centennial bloom's reproduction cycle, R.aip'u\u0101ng's rotation period completes once every 100 MXY.\nStanding half a meter tall at its highest, the centennial bloom is a small tree that varies in coloration depending on its particular cultivar. The most common variety has a sturdy, woody trunk with dark-brown and light-brown horizontal banding and dark-green elliptic leaves. Its light-pink flowers are bilaterally symmetrical and have stamens about twice as long as the flower itself. During the short time it blooms, it gives off an earthy scent. Flies and other carrion-eating bugs are its main pollinators on its world of origin, Ko\u2019li. The flower blooms for around 40 hours before it starts to wither, putting all its energy into reproduction.\nThe centennial bloom grows a small, dark-purple berry that\u2019s eaten by local wildlife and propagated in the surrounding areas. Its native desert climate dries out the seeds in preparation for the rainy season. It takes a seed one full Xi\u2019an year to sprout. During that year, it must only be watered sporadically and must never be allowed to remain wet for more than 20 hours or the seed is in danger of rotting. Centennial blooms on R.aip\u2019u\u0101ng grown in more temperate areas are kept dry through constant, careful attention and specialized equipment that mimics the day/night cycle on Ko\u2019li. Lovers of the centennial bloom often keep theirs in a sealed arcology that automatically regulates the environment to suit the plant\u2019s needs. Over the past decade, it has increased in popularity as a shipboard plant\nLi\u2019tova is a spiritual practice centered around the understanding of time. One of the main facets scholars contemplate is the way actions ripple backwards and forwards across time. Acknowledging the seen and unseen ramifications of one\u2019s deeds is one of the core principles in the Li\u2019tova code of ethics. Other aspects include the exploration of time as a dimension, the perception of time on an individual level through metabolic manipulation under meditation, and the measurement of time on a collective level. The centennial bloom\u2019s 100-year flowering cycle appeared to the explorers who discovered it on Ko\u2019li to be a poetic manifestation of Li\u2019tova itself. The plant was extracted from Ko\u2019li en masse before its terraforming and exported to R.aip\u2019u\u0101ng to be raised and contemplated.\nAt the end of the Xi\u2019an-Human Cold War in 2793 (III.1053), Emperor Kr.\u0113 invited the new ImperatorErin Toi for a tour of R.aip\u2019u\u0101ng. Though the existence of the jump point was public knowledge, Humans had long been barred from entering the \u0112\u2019aluth system. The Emperor personally clipped a branch from a centennial bloom and handed it to Toi. The offer of the centennial bloom and the subsequent opening of the system to all Humans were gestures of peace, made in the hope that the previous age of strife and misunderstanding between the United Empire of Earth and the Xi\u2019an Empire would be replaced with one of cultural exchange and harmony.\n",
    "Central Headquarters and Shared Services Center": "The Central Headquarters and Shared Services Center (aka Central Tower) is the name of the main headquarters of Hurston Dynamics located in the capital city of Lorville. It also has the distinction of being the largest building on Hurston (Stanton I). The CEO's office, a showroom for the products of Hurston Dynamics, and the command center of the planet's surveillance force can all be found within the walls of Central Tower.\n",
    "Charon IV": "Charon IV is an ice giant in the Charon system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Its atmosphere, composed mainly of methane and ammonia, is icy blue, giving the planet an almost white appearance when viewed from orbit. When Max Keaton discovered the Charon system in 2538, the sight of the gas giant's pale skies inspired him to name the system after Charon, ferryman of the dead.\n",
    "Checkmate Station": "Checkmate Station, formerly designated PYAM-FARSTAT-2-4, is a space station that orbits the star of the Pyro system in the L4 Lagrange point of Monox (Pyro II). Originally constructed as a resupply satellite for workers on Monox, it was abandoned when Pyrotechnic Amalgamated went out of business in 2563. Various outlaw gangs have laid claim to it, sometimes changing the station's name to reflect who controls it. Currently, the Rough & Ready gang are in charge, and are responsible for its current moniker. The group allows travelers through Pyro to stop at Checkmate Station to refuel their ships, purchase supplies, and indulge in entertainment.\n",
    "Chemline Solutions": "Chemline Solutions (CS) is a Human manufacturer and distributor of industrial chemicals. It was founded in 2889 by Victor Zahid, a businessman, and his twin sister Adorai Zahid, a geological engineer, after Adorai\u2019s company Edo Inc. cancelled her project to develop a new kind of resource extraction technology. While Adorai worked to complete her research, CS supplied chemicals to various companies in order to build up the company\u2019s reputation. In 2904, CS activated their first gas mining facility on the moon of Odin I, Gainey. Though CS was successful in harvesting gas from deep inside Gainey, it caused dangerous seismic events. Adorai sued Victor for rights to her technology when he fired her for her continued dissent against a plan to build another extraction facility on a populated world. The highly-publicized legal battle severely impacted the company\u2019s reputation. No longer able to maintain the Gainey facility, CS closed it in 2919 and sealed it in 2923.\n",
    "Chibanzoo Cream": "Chibanzoo Cream is a brand of liqueur manufactured on Cassel (Goss II). It was first brewed by the original settlers of the planet from the local chibanzoo berries. The earliest version of the liqueur was more tart than sweet, and was generally mixed with sugar syrup and cold soda water. As the chibanzoo has become more sugary over centuries of commercial use, the liqueur has grown to have a sweeter profile that still maintains its sour edge. While it can be consumed as a standalone beverage, it is most often used as a cocktail ingredient.\n",
    "Chronos System": "The Chronos system is a planetary system in the United Empire of Earth (UEE), and is made up of a mesoplanet, a rocky planet, and a G-type star. With only two planets, both uninhabited and unable to be terraformed, the system would likely have not risen to prominence if it weren't chosen to be the home of Project Archangel, the UEE's long-term scientific endeavor to create a fully artificial planet. Commonly known as Synthworld, Chronos III has been under construction for over seven decades.\n",
    "Church of the Journey": "The Church of the Journey is a system of beliefs that rose to prominence among Humans in the late 29th century. In 2876 its founder, Vita Perry, developed a meditation technique to be undertaken before, during, and after long journeys. The technique was meant to enhance its practitioner\u2019s appreciation of their path through life via understanding how a journey had changed them, delight in a journey begun, acceptance of a journey ended, and anticipation of the next journey. By the late 2890s, a code of morals centered around passing through the universe with as little impact upon it as possible developed alongside the meditation practice. Followers of this code are known as Journeymen.\n",
    "Citizen Day": "Citizen Day is a holiday observed annually in the United Empire of Earth (UEE) on October tenth. It was established to recognize the achievements of Humans who have attained Citizenship through civic responsibility, military service, altruistic work, or other positive and impactful contributions to their communities. It is also the day in which new Citizens are formally recognized. The recognition ceremony takes place at the Citizen Day Conference (also known as CitizenCon), an event held in a new city in the UEE every year.\nIt was seen primarily as a bank holiday until 2734, when Galor Messer IX used xenophobic propaganda to turn it into a tool boost military recruitment and held lavish celebrations in honor of Citizens\u2019 sacrifices for the betterment of the UEE. In the second half of the 28th century, anti-Messer activists on Terra used the holiday to recruit others to their cause. After the Messers fell, the new ImperatorErin Toi held the first Citizen Day Conference in New York City, Earth (Sol III) on 10 October 2793.\n",
    "Citizens for Pyro": "Citizens for Pyro is a civilian non-profit organization that hopes to expand the non-outlaw population of the Pyro system until it has a stable enough community for the United Empire of Earth (UEE) to finally claim Pyro as its own. Madge \"Dash\" Hartford originally established the organization in 2950 with the goal of eradicating all criminals from Pyro, after her best friend Kyuwa Endicott was caught in the crossfire between rival gangs and killed. After leading multiple missions into Pyro to hunt down outlaws, Hartford concluded that the only way to truly make the system safe would be to increase the viability of non-criminal settlements and attract commercial interests to the area. Over time, and with the backing of commercial enterprises, she believes that civilian interests will grow powerful enough to overpower Pyro's criminal element. Since then, Citizens for Pyro has been recruiting new members and raising funds to establish a major settlement on Bloom (Pyro III).\n",

Born on Cestulus (Davien II), he joined a navjumping crew in 2529 when he answered a local job posting. In 2538, he suffered a starship crash that required eight months of inpatient care and resulted in the loss of one of his legs. The insurance payout from the crash left him with enough money to purchase a new ship, which he did the day he was discharged from the medstation where he'd been recuperating. He headed to the then-Nivelin system and began scanning. Three weeks later, he picked up minute traces of a strange signal, which upon close investigation, proved to be a jump point to a previously-unknown planetary system. Kosoko reported his discovery to the United Planets of Earth (UPE) government and requested that the system be named Odara, after his aunt. It was renamed Gurzil and added to the Perry Line in 2542, when the R.il'a-Odara jump point was discovered. Kosoko remained a navjumper until his death in 2581 due to a malfunction in his ship's air recycling system.\n",

    "Daniel Penselin": "Dr. Daniel Penselin (2445 - 2496) was a physicist whose work improved the fuel economy of Humanquantum drives. In 2491, Penselin published a paper outlining a working hypothesis for the creation of more efficient quantum drives that would allow for an approximate 20 percent reduction in fuel use. Penselin\u2019s research funding ran dry soon after this due to budget cutbacks in the astroengineering department of Astravin University. When he could not secure financial backing elsewhere, Penselin modified the drive of his own spacecraft, the Lilienthal, and launched it for a test run in 2496. The ship crashed into the moon of Cestulus (Davien II) after a catastrophic system failure. Based on the ship\u2019s logs and an analysis of its flight path, however, it was proven that the Lilienthal did indeed consume far less fuel during quantum travel. After modifications were made to his research to combat the safety issue, Penselin\u2019s work was made standard in all quantum drives, and the moon upon which he died was named in his honor.\n",
    "Daniela Argen": "Daniela Argen (2762 - 2838) was a United Empire of Earth (UEE) Senator of Locke (Idris IV) from 2801 to 2827. First elected under a platform of revitalizing the economy, she spearheaded a series of tax breaks for first-time business owners and instituted a hiring program that decreased Locke's overall unemployment rate. In 2815, she presented a proposal to the UEE Senate outlining a detailed plan to construct a maximum security prison and an antimatter processing plant on Kellog VI. She argued that the heavy guard presence would serve as an early warning system against Vanduul incursions through the then-newly discovered jump points to Virgil and Vector without costing additional military resources, and the plant would generate revenue and provide the UEE with a steady stream of antimatter. Her plan was approved. During her third term, Argen was arrested by the Advocacy on charges of accepting bribes, and was forced to resign. After a trial, she was fined for her actions and went on to become a private business consultant. In 2838, she was found dead in a hotel room on Asura (Ferron III), having suffered multiple stab wounds. Her murder remains unsolved.\n",

People and businesses flocked to Davien after this, in spite of the thin atmosphere present in the system\u2019s only inhabitable planet, Cestulus (Davien II). The 2546 Atrocity at Jata on Cestulus was a political flashpoint in the leadup to Ivar Messer I\u2019s ascension to Prime Citizen and ultimately Imperator.\n",
    "Day of the Vara": "Day of the Vara is a holiday celebrated in the United Empire of Earth (UEE) annually on October 27th. The holiday involves public festivals adorned with decorations in black and green and private gatherings convened to remember and honor the dead. Celebrants dress up as people who have passed away or in other costumes and swap scary stories, especially pertaining to mysterious incidents in space. It is seen by Humans as a day that gives equal weight to the joy of life and the macabre.\nThe holiday first originated around 27 October 2557 after the disappearance of the Vara, an exploration vessel orbiting the second planet in the then-recently discovered Hades system. Communications from the Vara to the Rhetor system stopped early in the morning, after captain Tisiphone Heptane sent her initial impressions of the ruined alien cities. Systems on board ceased transmitting ship status reports a few hours later. Though search and rescue teams were dispatched the next day, the Vara and her crew were nowhere to be found. No wreckage or remains were ever located.\nIn the years following this disappearance, rumors spread among haulers and travelers that something malevolent lurked in the Hades system. People began to avoid flying through it on the anniversary of the Vara\u2019s demise because on that day, the ship and her crew would supposedly return from the dead and haunt the system. Stories would vary about what would happen to those who encountered the ship but all of them touched on fears surrounding space travel: sometimes the undead crew would secretly board passing vessels to sabotage vital systems; other stories had them haunt the living until they went insane and vented their own ship; in some, scavengers would happen across an abandoned spacecraft, only for the frozen bodies aboard to come alive at the worst possible moment. Horror stories like these remain a major part of Day of the Vara.\nOne of the lighter tales that became popular involved a protagonist who disguised themselves as a Vara crew member, which inspired others to dress as the deceased to protect themselves from bad luck in space travel. Members of Terra\u2019s (Terra III) counterculture picked up on the superstition and threw the first official Day of the Vara event on 27 October 2593. Many attendees dressed as ImperatorIvar Messer I, who had died in 2592, ostensibly to ward off evil. Songs celebrating Messer\u2019s demise that circulated among the crows that night indicated otherwise. Deacon Messer II and the UEE government spun the footage as support for the government and encouraged more Day of the Vara celebrations in 2594, describing it as a way to \"fondly remember those who have been lost.\" The campaign was successful; today, the holiday is primarily seen as a day to dress up as and honor those who have passed. It was officially established as an annual holiday in 2595.\nIn addition to wearing costumes, remembering dead loved ones, and swapping scary stories, revelers practice traditions adapted from various other festivals that celebrate the dead, such as indulging in food and drink like spirit cakes and iced wine, lighting candles, and staying up until the first morning light. Those celebrating on space stations rely on the artificial day/night cycle to signal festivity\u2019s end. Many long-term spacers consider it bad luck to skip the holiday, lest they attract unfavorable attention from the dead. Holos of dead loved ones are often brought out and adorned with green and black ribbons, a reference to colors of the Vara crew\u2019s uniforms. A hauler on a job might set up a holo of a dead celebrity and adjust the colors for lack of better options. Those on long haul journeys or on explorer vessels still avoid travel to the Hades system in late October.\n",

Recent economic forecasts list the majority of Dellin\u2019s inhabitants as living below the poverty line, but just above minimum requirements from the UEE Common Laws. This may have been one of the key factors in the election of Tarquin Klast as the governor, who has introduced controversial legislation that political news outlets claim removes many of the checks and balances that prevent the creation of a dictatorship. In 2944, there was a failed attack designed to oust Klast from power orchestrated by Acheron, another state on Charon III. Since then, the two states have been at war.

According to his journals, Price watched a ship appear out of thin air and collect the goods. He secretly tracked the ship until it vanished into what he was sure was a previously undiscovered jump point. After successfully navigating to the system, he overheard comm chatter between the outlaws, and found out that they were a group of Human separatists that were raiding ships only when they needed supplies. Though conflicted, he reported what he had found to his superiors. The Navy responded by dispatching strike teams to secure the outlaws. When they attempted to flee, the military destroyed their ships. In 2590, Price wrote in his journals that he had been dealing with a constant sense of guilt after his actions directly led to the deaths of so many.

There were no casualties thanks to an early detection and evacuation, but the institute funding the station elected not to rebuild after it was unable to secure additional grant money from the United Empire of Earth (UEE).\n",
    "Genesis II": "Genesis II is a terrestrial planet in the developing Genesis system. Situated in the temperate green band around its star, it has oceans of liquid water interspersed with thickly forested continents. It was declared a protected planet under the Fair Chance Act (FCA) the same year it was discovered in 2812 due to the presence of multiple sentient species on its surface and in its seas. In 2942, cephalopod-like, ocean-dwelling creatures were observed exploring one of the landmasses. This sparked a violent confrontation with the dominant land-based species. As the conflict continues, scientists and academics have begun to question the morality of noninterference in the war as required by the FCA.\n",
    "Genesis III": "Genesis III is an ice giant in the developing Genesis system. Located beyond the frost line, it has an upper atmosphere of hydrogen and helium, and a mantle composed of volatile chemical compounds such as ammonia, methane, and water in a supercritical fluid state.

    "Geohacking": "Geohacking is a colloquialism that refers to the practice of altering the environment of an already habitable planet. Geohacking is different from terraforming in that it is done upon planets and moons that already have established atmospheres and environments. It can also refer to modifications done on a smaller scale, and primarily to alter a world\u2019s weather system. The Xi\u2019an Empire utilizes the planets of the Th.us\u2019\u016bng system for its ongoing research into geohacking and terraforming technologies.\n",
    "Ghata Veras": "Ghata Veras (2887 - present) is the Senator of Lo (Corel III), United Empire of Earth (UEE). After serving in the UEE Army for fifteen years, Veras earned his Citizenship and ran for a seat on the Governors Council of Lo under a campaign promise to decrease taxes on middle and lower income individuals. He took office in 2920, and while on the Council, joined a committee that successfully pushed through a 3% decrease on income tax planet-wide. In 2941, he was elected as Senator of Lo on the Centralist party ticket. Since taking office, he has continued to fight for lower taxes, and has helped craft several consumer-protection laws that decrease the amount of data that can be harvested and sold without notice. Ghata spearheaded a campaign in 2943 to decommission the maximum security prison QuarterDeck located on Kellog VI, citing a history of Human-rights violations. Although the proposal was ultimately unsuccessful, political commentators expect Ghata to try again under a more favorable political climate.\n",

    "Glaive": "The \u201cGlaive\u201d is the official United Empire of EarthNavy (UEEN) designation for a fighter spacecraft operated by Vanduul forces. The Glaive is notable for its double bladed wings, in contrast to the Scythe\u2019s single bladed wing, as well as the inclusion of a missile rack and a neutron gun. Glaives appear with a much lower frequency than Scythes. Owing to their proficiency in battle, there is some indication that they are typically flown by veteran Vanduul pilots, though this has yet to be proven. Human manufacturer Esperia has produced limited numbers of a Glaive replica spacecraft for civilian sale.\n",
    "Gold Horizon": "Gold Horizon was a Human orbital platform manufacturing company that went defunct in 2655. Established as a prospecting corporation in 2546, the company transitioned to manufacturing prefabricated mining stations, and then to terraforming support stations, which made up the bulk of its business. Imperator Corsen Messer V nationalized all terraforming support concerns in 2654, halting the company\u2019s main line of profit. Gold Horizon officially ceased business in 2655, but some of their old stations can still be found around the universe.\n",

    "Golden Medmon": "The golden medmon is a fruit indigenous to Jalan (Elysium IV), cultivated by Tevarin over hundreds of years for its nutritious seeds and hydrating flesh. In its natural state, the fruit is very firm and astringent. While Tevarin prefer to eat it raw, Humans prefer to let the fruit soften once it has been harvested. After the fruit wrinkles and darkens, the flesh loses much of its moisture and gains a very sweet flavor along with a creamy consistency reminiscent of caramel.\n",
    "Gonn (Oberon I)": "Gonn is the first planet from the neutron star of the unclaimed Oberon system. A super-Earth that was once the core of a brown dwarf, this planet is rich in carbon and has long been rumored to hide vast deposits of diamonds that have yet to be discovered. Because the extreme environmental conditions make it difficult for automated facilities to operate, most miners that operate on Gonn are independent. According to local legend, one of the earliest miners on the planet used to chase away rivals while yelling, in a Cathcart regional dialect, \"Chinewa bedda get gonn,\" thus giving Oberon I its name.\n",
    "Gorgon Defender Industries": "Gorgon Defender Industries is a Human spacecraft shield systems manufacturer. Gorgon was founded by survivors of Fall of Caliban (2884) interested in selling high-quality defensive systems to civilians. In 2942, Gorgon signed their first military contract with the United Empire of Earth to produce shield modules for combat spacecraft.\n",
    "Goss I": "Goss I is the first planet from the suns of the Goss system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). The system's breadbasket, much of the planet consists of farmland dedicated to supplying itself and its sister planets with food. Instead of an ocean, it is covered in springs, lakes, rivers, seas and other bodies of water. The largest of these, the Salann Sea, is so salty that it is uninhabitable to all but a few species.\n",
    "Goss III": "Goss III is a terrestrial super-Earth located in the Goss system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). The furthest world from its systems suns, Goss III is temperate and heavily forested with multiple tropical and subtropical biomes.

    "Goss System": "The Goss system is a planetary system in the United Empire of Earth (UEE) that consists of two K-type main sequence stars, two rocky planets, and one super-Earth. All three of its planets are habitable, and have skies streaked with bands of turquoise, orange, and gold due the system's proximity to the nearby Olympus Pool; a dense, highly-reflective cloud of cosmic dust. These unique skies combined with beautiful coastlines and warm seas have made its second planet Cassel (Goss II) a major tourist destination. Thanks to the revenue generated from tourism and the abundance of food and resources found on Goss I, the system is largely self-sufficient.\n",
    "Grand Flabellum": "The grand flabellum is a genetically modified plant created by Rayari Inc. In 2930, it debuted as part of their new line of plants designed to aid in the terraforming process.

    "Green Band": "Also known as the habitable zone, Goldilocks zone, or circumstellar habitable zone, the green band of a planetary system is the area in which it is possible for liquid water to exist on the surface of a planet given sufficient atmospheric pressure, either naturally or through artificial intervention. This area varies from star to star, and is calculated based on stellar luminosity, among other factors.\n",
    "Green Imperial Housing Exchange (Grim HEX)": "The Green Imperial Housing Exchange, also known as Grim HEX, is a housing exchange located in the ring of Yela (Stanton 2c) that was closed in 2938 and subsequently fell under the control of criminals. Completed in 2903, the exchange was constructed inside an asteroid to provide affordable housing for workers and supervisors tied to nearby mining operations. Profits from rent easily covered the cost of maintenance until 2933, when most of the mines in the ring of Yela began to decline. Many of the inhabitants left when their jobs ended, cutting off the station's main source of revenue, and it fell into disrepair. After it was officially shut down in 2938, squatters, smugglers, transients, and others moved in, and a black market established itself there away from the jurisdiction of authorities on Crusader (Stanton II). The first recorded usage of the nickname Grim HEX was from a police interrogation of a local criminal in 2938.\n",
    "Greycat Industrial": "Greycat Industrial is a Human manufacturing company that produces armor, industrial equipment, and utility vehicles. Founded on Mars in 2337, Greycat is one of the oldest still-operating corporations in the United Empire of Earth (UEE).

Today, Greycat\u2019s best-known product is the Personal Transport Vehicle (PTV), sometimes referred to informally as the Greycat.\n",
    "Gurzil Belt Alpha": "The Gurzil belt alpha is a protoplanetary disk that orbits the sun of the developing Gurzil system. Still in its infancy, it is a swirling mass of dust, asteroids, and planetessimals. During the Xi'an-Human Cold War (SEY 2530 - 2793), many spacecraft from both sides of the conflict were lost in the Gurzil belt, officially due to poor visibility. Salvage companies under contract from the United Empire of Earth (UEE) government are engaged in long-term cleanup operations to remove wrecks and anti-ship mines that were abandoned in the system after the territory was ceded to the UEE under the terms of the 2789 Akari-Kr.\u0113 Treaty.\n",
    "Gurzil System": "The Gurzil system is a developing planetary system that consists of a K-type main sequence star and a vast protoplanetary disk. First discovered in 2539 by Human explorer Dahunsil Kosoko after he spent three weeks scanning the Hadrian system, it was discovered again in 2542 by Xi'an explorer N\u0113\" se Ruoth via a jump point from the R.il'a system, a stronghold of the Xi'an military. The United Empire of Earth (UEE) government responded by incorporating the then-Odara system into the Perry Line and changing its name to Gurzil, after an ancient Human deity of war. Following the fall of the Messers and dissolution of the Perry Line, Gurzil was placed under UEE control. The Senate debated placing the system under the protection of the Fair Chance Act but ultimately decided against it. Today, it is inhabited mainly by miners, salvagers, and scientists engaged in the long-term study of early planetary system development.\n",
    "H.au'u (Th.us'\u016bng V)": "H.au'u (Th.us'\u016bng V) is the fifth world from the sun of the Th.us'\u016bng system, Xi'an Empire (SaoXy'an). A dwarf planet with very low gravity, it lacks a substantial atmosphere, and conditions on its surface are nearly identical to being in the vacuum of space. It is believed that the Xi'an government utilizes the planet to conduct experiments here that are considered too hazardous to be done elsewhere in the system.\n",
    "Hades Extinction Event": "The Hadesian extinction event marks when the earliest known inhabitants of the Hades system disappeared. Current research estimates that the extinction event occurred at roughly 300000 BCE, but ongoing study of the archaeological record of the lost civilization continues to refine science's understanding of what happened. There are multiple theories of what specifically caused the extinction event. One of the more widely accepted hypotheses is that the Hadesians were wiped out by a devastating interplanetary war. Detractors point to a lack of evidence for technology that could have caused destruction on such a large scale.\n",
    "Hades I": "Hades I is the first planet from the sun of the Hades system. Located just on the inner edge of the system's green band, ruins on its surface suggest that the lost civilization of Hades may once have operated colonies there in spite of its high temperature. It is dotted with impact craters that seem to have been caused by weapons. Some scholars believe that Hades I once had an atmosphere, but it was blasted away during the war that ultimately destroyed the Hadesians. Research to settle this question is ongoing.\n",
    "Hades II": "Hades II is the second planet from the sun of the Hades system. Once inhabited by the lost Hadesian civilization, ruins of ancient cities can be found on the planet under layers of volcanic ash. The lack of moisture and air underneath the ash layers has kept the objects that lay within them almost perfectly preserved. They are of special interest to archaeologists because they represent the best remains of the destroyed Hadesian culture. Any ruins left exposed to the violent atmosphere of the dead planet have been eradicated over time.\n",
    "Hades III": "Hades III is a smog planet in the Hades system. Its high-pressure, toxic atmosphere covers a landscape riddled with impact craters and the scant remains of abandoned cities. Due to dangerous conditions, researchers have only been able to make a few expeditions to explore and document these ruins. Planetary scans show that while nearly all of these sites have been eroded away, many more ruins lie buried beneath the surface.\n",
    "Hades IV": "Hades IV is a former planet in the Hades system. Once a sizable terrestrial world, it is split into two large pieces. The leading theory as to the cause of the planet's bifurcation is that it was likely impacted by a weapon of mass destruction during the ancient war that eradicated all life from the system. It's unclear if the world was ever inhabited, but its destruction indicates that it was strategically important to the Hadesians. Any structures that may have existed on its surface were obliterated when the planet was destroyed.\n",
    "Hades System": "The Hades system is a planetary system that consists of an F-type main sequence star, a mesoplanet, two terrestrial planets, and one broken terrestrial planet. First visited by Humans in 2531, it was immediately obvious that the system had once been home to a previously unknown spacefaring civilization that vanished after an interplanetary war. Although officially unclaimed, the Hades is loosely protected by a mixture of private security firms guarding academic expeditions and sparse United Empire of Earth (UEE) personnel protecting the trafficked shipping lane that runs through the system.\nHades, the system's star, is an F-type main sequence star roughly five billion years old. The closest planetary body to Hades is Hades I, a mesoplanet covered with impact craters. Two of its three terrestrial planets, Hades II and Hades III, are in the temperate zone of the system's green band. Hades IV, a terrestrial planet that was cracked in half by what historians believe was an ancient weapon, is located in the green band's frigid outer edge. There is evidence that at one point, most of the planets in the system were inhabited, including the dangerously hot Hades I.\nIn 2515, the scanners of the tramp freighter Merry Crow picked up an anomaly in the Nexus system. After an investigation, the crew found that it was a previously undocumented jump point. At the time, they were in possession of several hundred freight units of stolen fusion drives, which they were smuggling to the Ellis system. The crew voted to keep the jump point's location to themselves and continue on their route rather than risk arrest by reporting the discovery. Although they planned to return to the jump point and navigate it to determine whether it connected to a known system or a new system, which would net them a much larger payout, circumstances prevented this. In 2529, the ship's navigator Jake Tapps became the only survivor of this crew when a deal went bad and the others were killed in a firefight. Tapps sold the logbooks of the Merry Crow to the Dynamo Corporation in 2531.\nAfter navigating the jump point, the Dynamo Corporation realized they had discovered a new planetary system and dispatched a team to survey their find. Initial scans revealed remnants of a previously-unknown ancient civilization on most of its planets. One worker commented that the desolate ruins looked like cities of the dead, and the company began to call the system Hades after an ancient Human god of death and the underworld. At first, leadership of the company wanted to proceed with terraforming in spite of these ruins, but when it was confirmed that Hades II and Hades III could not be terraformed under the limits of then-current technology, they elected to turn the system over to the United Planets of Earth (UPE) government and the collect substantial reward money it offered for their discovery.\nThe UPE claimed the new system in light of its historical significance. Early expeditions were extensive, and xenoarchaeologists excavated and documented a great deal of information. However, the advent of the First Tevarin War in 2541 led to the UPE retracting their protection of the system in favor of directing military resources to the ongoing conflict. When Imperator Ivar Messer I took power in 2546, the newly formed United Empire of Earth (UEE) government continued to leave the system unprotected, leaving it vulnerable to grave robbers. Researchers had to hire private security for protection against these outlaws, which slowed down any new expeditions to a trickle.\nIn 2647, the xenoarchaeological faculty of Astravin University at Cestulus (AUC) published a joint paper outlining their theory that an interplanetary war wiped out the Hadesian civilization. Imperator Corsen Messer V grew interested in the possibility that ancient weapons of mass destruction might still be in Hades, and ordered the UEE Marines to conduct a thorough search. Many building sites and artifacts were destroyed as a side effect of this unregulated hunt, erasing untold amounts of possible sources of information about the Hadesians and their way of life.\nIt wasn't until the fall of the Messers in 2792 that Humans began to consider claiming Hades again. Hundreds of academic institutions across the UEE signed a petition asking the government to take responsibility for the invaluable system and bring it under their protection. However, the UEE's ongoing conflict with the Vanduul took priority over the safety of an archaeological site, and the system remains unclaimed to this day despite ongoing petitions.\nMost historians and archaeologists believe that the Hadesian civilization existed until sometime between 300,000 and 290,000 BCE. At that point, the Hadesians had colonized at least three of the four planets in the system. Hades II and Hades III were the most densely populated, and Hades I was home to a handful of settlements. It is not certain whether the civilization originated on Hades II or Hades III. Both planets have atmospheres that may once have supported life, evidence of ancient oceans and riverbeds, and are covered in the ruins of demolished cities. Fragments of writing recovered in the system are written in an identical language that has yet to be deciphered, suggesting that the planets were closely culturally related, and that there was trade and travel between them.\nThere is strong evidence that a devastating interplanetary war wiped out the once thriving civilization. The surface of each planet is covered in impact craters and the soil is contaminated by heavy metals and radioactivity. It is likely that the atmospheres of Hades II and Hades III were poisoned either through fallout from the conflict or via sabotage. If Hades I had an atmosphere at some point, as analysis of its surface has suggested, it was annihilated during the war. In these conditions, it is very unlikely that any form of life could survive. Additionally, the bifurcation of Hades IV implies that the Hadesians were in possession of a weapon capable of destroying entire planets, which may have been the ultimate instrument of their extinction.\nMuch of the artifacts of this civilization were lost thanks to the consequences of this war. Structures and goods that were not destroyed during the fighting were worn down by erosion, and any organic remains decayed into dust. On Hades II in some areas, a deep layer of ash lies on top of preserved buildings, offering the closest picture of daily life in the Hades system at the time of their disappearance.\nSince the system was open for travel, multiple people have reportedly seen a creature aboard their ships. It was first sighted in 2602 by navjumper Eli Thorn. According to Thorn, he caught something out of the corner of his eye as he was climbing down a ladder to middeck. He described it as a bipedal body with exposed musculature that was covered in blue veins. When he tried to get a direct look at it, the ship suddenly rocked, and it vanished.\nMany such sightings have been reported since Thorn first shared his account, with several people claiming they believe the creature is one of the long lost Hadesians themselves or possibly a ghost of a deceased Hadesian. Descriptions vary; some say the creature has multiple, tentacle-like appendages, while others say it has two arms. Some report that the encounter filled them with a sense of dread, and others feel a sense of urgency, like the creature is trying to communicate with them. All agree that when they try to look directly at it, it disappears.\n",
    "Hadesians": "Hadesian is the colloquial name for the indigenous inhabitants from the Hades system that achieved interplanetary space flight. They suffered a mass extinction at an undetermined point before the system's discovery in 2515. Precise dating has proven difficult, due to the harsh conditions on the surface of each previously-inhabited planet and the adverse effect of radiation from an unknown weapon or device.\n",
    "Hadrian Belt Alpha": "The Hadrian belt alpha is an asteroid belt in the Hadrian system, United Empire of Earth (UEE) that orbits between the system's second and third planets. Although it is abundant in resources, no corporation has elected to mine it due to the presence of undetonated anti-ship mines that remain from the Xi'an-Human Cold War (2530 - 2793). In 2936, independent miner Yubyeol Greene was killed in an explosion when her ship accidentally grazed an active mine.\n",
    "Hadrian I": "Hadrian I is a gas dwarf in the Hadrian system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). The closest planet to its sun, it has a rocky core and a thick, stormy hydrogen-helium atmosphere with tan and brown-black bands. Astrophysicists believe that Hadrian I became the system's innermost planet when its sun entered its red giant phase, destroying any other bodies close to it.\n",
    "Hadrian II": "Hadrian II is a planet in the Hadrian system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Relatively calm for a gas giant, its placid, bright blue atmosphere is orbited by hundreds of fuel refineries and gas mining operations. It was the main center of commerce in Hadrian until the 29th century, when it was eclipsed by industries related to trade with the Xi'an Empire.\n",
    "Hadrian III": "Hadrian III is an ice giant in the Hadrian system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Located in the outer reaches of the system, it has no well-defined solid surface, and instead harbors an ammonia, water, and methane mantle. Its pale green, nearly white atmosphere is broken up by an enormous, permanent dark storm cloud that circles the equator. Inhabitants of Hadrian have nicknamed it \"the Watcher\" due to its resemblance to a Human eye.\n",
    "Hadrian System": "The Hadrian system is a planetary system in the United Empire of Earth (UEE) that consists of a red giant, a gas giant, a gas dwarf, an asteroid belt, and an ice giant. Originally named Nivelin, it renamed Hadrian in 2542 after an ancient human defensive wall and turned into a military staging ground due to its jump point connection with the Perry Line system Gurzil. For the next two centuries, Hadrian was fortified with mines and outposts in preparation of a Xi'an attack that never came. Although it was demilitarized and reopened to civilians in 2793 at the end of the Xi'an-Human Cold War (2530 - 2793), many mines remain in the system's asteroid belt. Today, the military structures that have been declared safe have been converted into pit stops for those traveling between the UEE and the Xi'an Empire.\n",
    "Haldor Lily": "The haldor lily is a genetically modified plant created by Rayari Inc to aid in the terraforming process. Designed for strength and durability, the haldor lily can be planted on worlds that suffer torrential storms without drowning or breaking.

In general, Harvesters are several stories tall and typically transported on a carrier before being deployed onto the surface of a planet, asteroid, or other body from orbit. It then digs into the ground and begins to take in resources, automatically moving as it completes strip mining an area. Once a Harvester is full, they have been known to send out self-propelled pods full of processed materials to an orbiting ship, return to space themselves to be redeployed, or can possibly convert themselves into manufacturing centers. Harvesters on Tomb (Tiber II) have been observed using the resources they mine to manufacture additional Harvesters. The mechanism by which this is done is not yet understood or has not been revealed to the public.\n",
    "Hawk": "The Hawk is a light fighter developed by Anvil Aerospace for the United Empire of Earth Navy (UEEN). Initially developed as a dogfighter and ground attack vehicle in 2937, it saw only limited operations while in UEEN service.

The new model added a selection of EMP weaponry and a containment pod capable of carrying a passenger or prisoner.\n",
    "Headhunters": "The Headhunters are a major criminal organization based in the Pyro system that specializes in smuggling, theft, and protection. Originally from the Virgil system, the gang first rose to prominence as smugglers in the 2610s, when they established a fast shipping route from Virgil to Terra through Nyx and Pyro that proved to be difficult for authorities to detect. By the 2620s, they fully relocated to Ruin Station, where they could more easily avoid encounters with the Advocacy. It was during this era that they adopted the Human skull into their symbolism, and began including motifs of it in tattoos, personal decor, and graffiti. A location marked with a Headhunter skull warned other criminals that the area was under their control. Much of Pyro stayed under their influence until the criminal syndicate the Drop Kings challenged their authority in the 2740s in an effort to expand their smuggling network, resulting in a series of conflicts that caused control of Ruin Station to pass back and forth between the gangs for several decades. The Drop Kings ultimately withdrew when they clashed with another criminal syndicate in 2912. Since then, the gangs are officially on neutral terms, though they maintain a sense of rivalry.\n",

Massive and hydrogen-rich, it is the main source for hydrogen collection in Helios and is the hub for the system's gas processing and refinement operations. Its atmosphere is uniformly tan in color, lacking the distinctive bands often found on other gas giants of similar size.\n",
    "Helios IV": "Helios IV is the outermost planet from the sun of the Helios system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Although it is covered in thick sheets of ice and lacks a substantial atmosphere, the UEE military operates a network of outposts on Helios IV, located deep underground. The purpose of these facilities has never been publicly stated. Locals speculate that they are used for black-ops training or secret research, but no evidence to support these claims has ever been found.\n",
    "Helios System": "The Helios system is a planetary system in the United Empire of Earth (UEE), consisting of a peculiar main sequence B-type star, three terrestrial planets, and a gas giant. It was discovered in 2529 by a group of outlaws known as the Daybreak Marauders, who used it as a launching point for their frequent raids on convoys in the Ellis system. That same year, it was officially annexed by the United Planets of Earth (UPE) when Advocacy agents Avon Dorville and Gia Trask tracked the Daybreak Marauders to their hidden jump point in the Taranis system. The system's most populated planet, Tangaroa (Helios II), has a brackish water ocean that gives rise to waves hundreds of meters high.\n",
    "Henge Cluster (Terra Cluster Alpha)": "The Henge cluster (Terra cluster alpha) is an asteroid field located between the third and fourth planets from the sun in the Terra system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). High in metallic asteroids, much of the cluster has already been claimed by various major mining corporations. While independent mining is allowed, the high density of claims in the area has resulted in heavy regulations.\n",
    "Herald": "The Herald is a data runner spacecraft sold by Drake Interplanetary. It is an unusually specialized design for Drake, focusing entirely on the process of securely storing, transmitting, and moving data as quickly as possible. The Herald is built with an armored computer core and an STA-M6A1 high power broadcast array that allows for long range transmission. They are used by a variety of corporations and by independent contractors who specialize in data running missions.\n",
    "High Command": "The High Command is a governmental body in the United Empire of Earth (UEE), made up of three representatives from each branch of their military. These representatives, Legatus Navium, Legatus Exercitus, and Legatus Marinuum, replaced the Tribunal position of High General. Aside from overseeing the management of the military, they brief the Senate and the Imperator on military matters and facilitate the Imperator\u2019s orders. High Command was created in 2793 after the Anti-Messer Revolution, to prevent any future Imperators from using the military as an oppressive force.\n",
    "High-Advocate": "The High-Advocate is the leader of the judiciary and law enforcement branch in the United Empire of Earth (UEE). Laws that have passed through the Senate and have been approved by the Imperator are interpreted and enforced by the High-Advocate, then funneled to local governments for adoption. Originally created as an elected office in 2523, the position was dissolved by Ivar Messer I in 2546. It was re-established in 2793, after the events of the Anti-Messer Revolution deposed Imperator Linton Messer XI, ending over 200 years of despotic rule. The High-Advocate is nominated by the newly-elected Imperator but must be approved by the Directors Council, a committee composed of the heads of the various law enforcement and judicial departments that fall under the High Advocate\u2019s control. This structure was set up after the end of the Messer Era to prevent future Imperators from treating the Advocacy and other departments as a private security force.\n",
    "High-Secretary": "The High-Secretary is the chief executive of infrastructure in the United Empire of Earth (UEE), and oversees matters such as transportation, power, communications, sewage, and agriculture. Structural legislation that has been debated and refined by the Senate is passed first to the High-Secretary before it is passed to the Imperator for final approval. The position was originally created at the formation of the United Planets of Earth (UPE) in 2523 as part of the three-member Tribunal that would run the government. Ivar Messer I retired the office when he became Prime Citizen in 2546. After the events of the Anti-Messer Revolution in 2792, the office of High-Secretary was re-established as one appointed by the duly-elected Imperator, subject to final approval from the Senate.\n",
    "Historical Truth Act of 2941": "The Historical Truth Act is an information law passed in 2941 by the United Empire of Earth (UEE)Senate that declassified thousands of documents created during the Messer Era (2546 - 2792). It defines records created by the Messers and those associated with them as subject to disclosure, outlines the declassification procedures, and describes the circumstances under which exemptions to the law are allowed. Created to expose the Messers\u2019 abuse of government power to the public, it unsealed military records, confirmed the existence of previously classified spacecraft, unearthed secret projects, and revealed the fates of many people who had disappeared under mysterious circumstances.\n",
    "Hoplite": "The Vanguard Hoplite is a variant of the Vanguard deep space fighter developed by Aegis Dynamics. The design replaces the standard escape pod located amid-ship with weapons racks and cradles to support a squad of armored soldiers. The United Empire of Earth Navy (UEEN) utilizes the Hoplite for boarding and air to ground operations.\n",
    "Horus Belt Alpha": "The Horus belt alpha is the first asteroid belt from the sun of the Horus system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). It is the most active center of mining operations in the system, providing Serling (Horus I) with materials that cannot be extracted planetside without threatening the delicate balance of its environment. In 2911, a small mining outpost set up on one of the belt's larger asteroids had a defective filter installed during construction which led to the presence of a constant pall of dust that caused long-term respiratory problems in its inhabitants. A court case following this incident against the filter's manufacturer forced an industry-wide overhaul in regulations compliance.\n",
    "Horus Belt Beta": "The Horus belt beta is the second asteroid belt from the sun of the Horus system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). In contrast to its neighboring belt, it sees little commercial traffic aside from passing trade ships despite being located closer to the system's only inhabited planet Serling (Horus I). Marie Sante, who discovered the Horus system, kept a personal base on the largest asteroid in the Horus belt beta that she utilized when exploring the system's outer reaches. Left abandoned after her 2545 disappearance, the base was re-discovered in 2977 and was declared a cultural heritage site.\n",
    "Horus II": "Horus II is the second planet from the sun of the Horus system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Although it is located in the habitable zone, it lacks any natural bodies of water and does not have an atmosphere that can support life. After the 2947 signing of the Human-Xi'an Trade Initiative (HuXa), some of the old military bases on Horus II leftover from the Xi'an-Human Cold War were transformed into cargo exchange stations for traders passing through the R.il'a and Kai'pua jump points. There is growing public interest in the potential terraformation of Horus II as trade between the UEE and the Xi'an Empire continues to increase.\n",
    "Horus III": "Horus III is a super-Jupiter on the Horus system, United Empire of Earth (UEE), and is the most distant planet from its sun. More massive than most other gas giants, it has a high-density atmosphere that compresses the planet, lowering its overall circumference in comparison to low-mass gas giants. Many rest stops and refueling stations orbit Horus III in support of travelers and traders that pass through Horus between the UEE and the Xi'an Empire.\n",
    "Horus System": "The Horus system is a planetary system in the United Empire of Earth (UEE) that consists of an M-type main sequence star, two terrestrial planets, a super-Jupiter, and two asteroid belts. In 2528, navjumper Marie Sante reported her discovery of the Horus system to the United Planets of Earth (UPE), alongside detailed documentation describing its celestial bodies. It was incorporated into the Perry Line when Sante discovered a jump point to the Xi'an-owned R.il'a system in 2542, after which the UPE closed Horus to non-military personnel. When the Perry Line was dissolved in 2793, the UEE government re-opened the system and oversaw the colonization of the tidally-locked planet Serling (Horus I). Horus' connection to the Xi'an Empire, once a hindrance to its development, is now the main driver of its economic growth.\n",
    "House Chii": "Chii was one of the four major Xi\u2019anHouses that fought in the Great Divide (20044 - 19770 BCE). Allied to House Uai\u2019i, it joined the war after hostilities between Ru\u2019a and Uai\u2019i became deadly. Though it was the largest House to survive the destruction of the Xi\u2019an homeworld\u2019s atmosphere in 19770 BCE, it was unable to gain significant power in the government restructuring that followed. Leadership of Chii attempted to seize power from Imperial House Ru\u2019a only thirteen years after the end of the Great Divide. As punishment for their actions, they were exterminated.\n",
    "House Kl.\u014d": "Kl.\u014d was one of the four major Houses in the Xi\u2019an Empire (SaoXy\u2019an) involved in the Great Divide(20044 - 19770 BCE). When the last daughter of Kl.\u014d attempted to defect to House Uai\u2019i, a move that would have ended her family line, a war broke out between the Houses. In the final year of the war, the Kl.\u014d forces were severely depleted; defeat appeared inevitable. Facing the possibility of their House\u2019s extinction, some members of House Kl.\u014d attempted to assassinate the leadership of houses Uai\u2019i, Ru\u2019a, and Chii by poisoning the air directly above peace talks on RyiXy'an (Hyoton III). Their act of sabotage accidentally started a chain reaction throughout RyiXy'an\u2019s network of antique weather manipulation satellites that contaminated the entire planet\u2019s atmosphere, resulting in the death of millions and rendering the Xi\u2019an homeworld uninhabitable. As penance for their actions, House Kl.\u014d voluntarily chose not to continue their family line. They died out roughly 100 years after the end of the Great Divide.\n",
    "House Ng.at\u2019ak": "Ng.at\u2019ak (also known as \u2018Gatac\u2019) is one of the major Houses in the Xi\u2019an Empire (SaoXy\u2019an). During the Great Divide (20044 - 19770 BCE), Ng.at\u2019ak, a vassal of House Ru\u2019a, built and maintained vehicles and spacecraft that formed the backbone of Ru\u2019a\u2019s logistics operations. Three of Ng.at\u2019ak\u2019s elders perished alongside the leadership of Ru\u2019a when House Kl.\u014d unintentionally poisoned the atmosphere of the Xi\u2019an homeworld RyiXy'an (Hyoton III). When Ru\u2019a was made the first Imperial House in the aftermath of the tragedy, newly elevated Emperor Ya.l'\u0113 se Ru\u2019a rewarded Ng.at\u2019ak for their service by granting them exclusive rights to build industrial spacecraft for the SaoXy\u2019an in perpetuity. Today, Ng.at\u2019ak owns and operates Gatac Manufacture (Ao\u2019t.o\u2019a\u2019Ng.at\u2019ak) and maintains close familial ties with the current Imperial House.\n",
    "House Ru'a": "Ru\u2019a was the first Imperial House in the Xi\u2019an Empire (SaoXy'an). It was one of the four major Houses involved in the Great Divide (20044 - 19770 BCE), allied to the Kl.\u014d house against Houses Uai\u2019i and Chii. Alliances fractured over the years until all four Houses fought for themselves to achieve supreme power. As the Chii emerged as the likeliest victors, the leadership of Ru\u2019a and Uai\u2019i elected to attempt peace talks with the Chii on the Xi\u2019an homeworld RyiXy'an (Hyoton III), hoping to negotiate a ceasefire. However, all leaders of Ru\u2019a and some of Uai\u2019i and Chii were wiped out when the struggling House Kl.\u014d sabotaged RyiXy'an\u2019s network of antique weather manipulation satellites above the talks, inadvertently setting off a chain reaction that poisoned the atmosphere of the entire planet. All Xi\u2019an were forced to flee their homeworld.\nA surviving daughter of Ru\u2019a, Ya.l'\u0113, was named the first Emperor of the new unified government in recompense for her family\u2019s near-annihilation. She encoded the mores of Li\u2019tova into Xi\u2019an law. The House ruled until Se\u2019ang, the final Ru\u2019a Emperor and the last member of his line, stepped down in 878 BCE (I.14680), beginning the Second Imperial Age.\n",
    "House Uai'i": "Uai\u2019i is one of the major Houses in the Xi\u2019an Empire (SaoXy'an.) Credited with creating the first single-occupant spacecraft capable of exiting and re-entering the atmosphere, Uai\u2019i came to power in 26038 BCE. Before this point they were a minor but prosperous House, having written culinary treatise Three Leaves of Flavor around 29500 BCE. The attempted defection of the only daughter of House Kl.\u014d to Uai\u2019i incited the Great Divide(20044 - 19770 BCE), the Xi\u2019an civil war that rendered the Xi\u2019an homeword, RyiXy'an (Hyoton III), uninhabitable.\n",
    "House Xy.\u014d": "Xy.\u014d was the second Imperial House (Yii\u2019uaTao\u201d) in the Xi\u2019an Empire (SaoXy\u2019an). Selected by other major Houses in II.0 (878 BCE), the new Emperor Y.ah\u2019a se Xy.\u014d and the rest of her House commemorated the terraforming of R.aip\u2019u\u0101ng (Kai\u2019pua III) to be a spiritual center of Li\u2019tova in honor of the Ru\u2019a Line\u2019s millennia of service. The final Emperor Xy.\u014d and her entire family were exterminated by the Kr\u2019thak in II.1706 (SEY 1305), during the Spirit Wars (II.961 - II.1735; SEY 351 - 1342). Their destruction led to the Dark (II.1706 - II.1824; SEY 1305 - 1457), a period of Xi\u2019an history beset by anarchy and cultural decline.\n",
    "Housing Exchanges (HEX)": "Housing Exchanges (HEX) are a common name for prefabricated facilities established inside hollowed asteroids and other frontier locations. They are simple, interconnected living spaces built to sustain workers and passing travelers at locations where constructing bespoke housing would be either too difficult or unnecessary. The first HEXs were manufactured by Everline Structures Incorporated and have since been imitated by other corporations.\n",
    "Hua'nam (Th.us'\u016bng IV)": "Hua\u2019nam (Th.us'\u016bng IV) is a gas giant in the Th.us'\u016bng system, Xi'an Empire (SaoXy'an), and is the fourth planet from its sun. A pressurized research station constructed, owned, and operated by the Xi'an government is located inside Hua'nam's stormy hydrogen-helium atmosphere, at depths currently unreachable via Human technological means. The Xi'an government has not publicly shared the methods they utilized to construct this station.\n",
    "Huichuaihyao sy.en'o se La'uo (La'uo belt beta)": "The Huichuaihyao sy.en'o se La'uo (La'uo belt beta) is an asteroid belt in the La'uo system, Xi'an Empire (SaoXy'an). Located between Kyu'\u0101m (La'uo III) and S.ap'u\u0101ng (La'uo IV), it hosts a large concentration of asteroids that are coated in highly prized, very pure water ice. The nyayu'a who reside on the system utilize ice harvested from these asteroids as a source of fresh water. Some Xi'an mining consortiums have entered into agreements with the nyayu'a to conduct operations here in exchange for peacefully ceding a small percentage of their cargo if they are boarded.\n",
    "Huichuaihyao y.ath'o se La'uo (La'uo belt alpha)": "The Huichuaihyao y.ath'o se La'uo (La'uo belt alpha) is an asteroid belt in the La'uo system, Xi'an Empire (SaoXy'an). In the space between Yengchuai (La'uo II) and Kyu'\u0101m (La'uo III), a large planetesimal abundant in metals and minerals once orbited La'uo's star during the time the system was first forming. However, it failed to gather enough material to coalesce into a full planet and eventually broke apart to form this asteroid belt.\n",
    "Huichuaihyao y.ath'o se Th.us'\u016bng": "The Huichuaihyao y.ath'o se Th.us\u016bng (Th.us'\u016bng belt alpha) is an asteroid belt in the Th.us'\u016bng system, Xi'an Empire (SaoXy'an). Rich in valuable mineral resources, Kathryn Segovia cited its presence as a primary motivating factor in her decision to sell the location of the Th.us'\u016bng-Baker jump point to terraforming organization Gaia Planet Services. However, the company's plans to mine the belt were halted before when they inadvertently made first contact with the Xi'an Empire.\n",
    "Huichuaihyao y.ath'o se Y\u0101'mon (Y\u0101'mon Belt Alpha)": "The huichuaihyao y.ath\u2019o se Y\u0101\u2019mon (Y\u0101\u2019mon belt alpha) is an asteroid belt in the Y\u0101'mon system, Xi'an Empire. Used as a supplier of minerals for the Xi'an military, it was under heavy guard for the duration of the Xi'an-Human Cold War (SEY 2530 - 2793). Human scouts on observation missions were sometimes captured and held as political hostages until they could be exchanged for Xi'an prisoners kept in the United Empire of Earth (UEE). After the end of the Cold War, the belt was opened to commercial mining, and is one of the main resources of materials for the ongoing terraforming projects on Yethl\u016bl y.ath'o (Y\u0101'mon II) and Yethl\u016bl s.yen'o (Y\u0101'mon III).\n",
    "Hull A": "The Hull A is a freighter developed by MISC. The smallest and most affordable of the Hull series, the Hull A has limited defensive and maneuvering capabilities compared with similarly sized craft, but has commensurate carrying capacity. Many corporations have utilized the Hull A as a solution for the short range transport of goods from larger freighters to planetary surfaces.\n",
    "Hull C": "The Hull C is a modular bulk freighter produced by Musashi Industrial & Starflight Concern (MISC). It is capable of transporting large quantities of goods attached to the frame in standard cargo containers. The Hull C is the standard-bearer of the Hull line and is marketed as an adaptable solution to corporations requiring a fleet of smaller transports, as well as smaller businesses and organizations.\n",
    "Hull E": "The Hull E is a modular bulk freighter produced by Musashi Industrial & Starflight Concern (MISC). It is the largest freighter in the Hull line, and is capable of transporting a higher quantity of cargo than any other dedicated transport MISC produces. Due to high operating costs and the massive volume of goods required to outfit the ship to capacity, Hull E are typically utilized by larger corporations. Because their maneuverability is low, MISC recommends to its owners that they travel with escort craft.\n",
    "Human Colonial Expansion Era": "The Human Colonial Expansion Era (2380 - 2530) was a period marked by rapid discovery of jump points and planetary systems and outward expansion from the Human home system Sol. Historians believe that a drop in the price of spacecraft made exploration vessels more freely available to civilians, which led to an upward spike in the discovery of jump points. In 2380, the formation of the first pan-Human government, the United Nations of Earth (UNE), allowed mass proliferation of resources formerly available to a few. Bremen and Oretani were among the many systems discovered during this time. The rate of colonization fell after Humans made first contact with the Xi\u2019an in 2530.\n",
    "Human Overpopulation Era": "In the 21st and 22nd centuries (2038-2157), population levels on Earth (Sol III) began to rise beyond sustainable capacity. Pollution, overcrowding, dwindling resources, and famine affected all nations of the world. Natural wonders previously under protection from their governments were bulldozed over in favor of creating Human settlements or potential arable land. Countless animal and plant species became extinct. The successful terraforming of Mars in 2157 provided a much-needed outlet for population growth, ending the Overpopulation Era and opening Humanity\u2019s path to the stars.\n",
    "Human-Xi'an Trade Initiative (HuXa)": "The Human-Xi\u2019an Trade Initiative (HuXa) is a 2947 trade agreement between the United Empire of Earth (UEE) and the Xi\u2019an Empire (SaoXy\u2019an). Spearheaded by ImperatorKelos Costigan(b:2855 - present), it loosened restrictions on the export and import of goods between the two empires and established incentives for Xi\u2019anHouses to engage in business with Human companies. Negotiations for the 10,000 page HuXa were conducted in secret between Xi\u2019an and Human government officials on a one-to-one basis to prevent the private sector from speculation. In the runup to the vote, mercenary Maurice Vano attempted to assassinate Costigan. Though it was never confirmed if the attack was motivated by opposition to the HuXa, it inadvertently boosted public opinion on it. The Senate ratified the HuXa by a narrow margin after weeks of debate. Since its passing, multiple Houses such as Aopoa and Ng.at\u2019ak have debuted goods aimed at the Human market.\n",
    "Humans": "Humans are a spacefaring civilization originating on Earth (Sol III). They are capable of spaceflight, quantum travel, traversing jump points, and terraforming planets. Since achieving piloted spaceflight in SEY 1961, they have settled in over thirty planetary systems and established diplomatic relationships with the Banu and Xi'an, though they experienced a prolonged period of military tension with the Xi'an from 2530 - 2793. After the Second Tevarin War (2603 - 2610), the Tevarin were assimilated into the Human government, the United Empire of Earth (UEE). Their current leader is ImperatorLaylani Addison.\n",
    "Hurricane": "The Hurricane is a strike fighter manufactured by Anvil Aerospace. Originally launched in 2607 by the now defunct Casse Aerospace, the Hurricane is a turret fighter, combining the speed and maneuverability of an interceptor with a single manual turret operated by a second crewmember. The first model of the Hurricane was used by the United Empire of Earth Navy (UEEN) during the Second Tevarin War (2603-2610) where it saw limited combat. In 2871, the UEEN requested that Anvil Aerospace update the design for service against the Vanduul. New models were deployed in 2878.\n",
    "Hurston (Stanton I)": "Hurston is a hot, arid planet that orbits closest to the sun in the Stanton system. Discovered in 2851, it was sold by the United Empire of Earth (UEE) government to the company Hurston Dynamics in 2865. Unrestricted industry and mining, especially of antimatter precursor, have heavily polluted the atmosphere of the planet since the company took possession. Inhabitants are kept up to date on atmospheric conditions by a public air quality index. Lorville, the oldest and most populous city on Hurston, is home to Hurston Dynamics' headquarters, a towering structure nicknamed \"Central\" that casts a permanent shadow on the buildings below.\n",
    "Hurston Dynamics": "Hurston Dynamics is a Human weapons manufacturer and materials processor based on Hurston (Stanton I). They are the largest producer of standard munitions warheads for military contracts in the United Empire of Earth (UEE), as well as the third-largest refiner of antimatter precursor. Hurston Dynamics owns the planet upon which it is headquartered. The company has frequently been criticized for its controversial employee contracts and its disregard for Hurston\u2019s ecology.\n",
    "Hydrogen Fuel": "Hydrogen fuel is a colorless, odorless fuel derived from hydrogen that is primarily used to power conventional spacecraft engines during non quantum flight. It is mostly collected by spacecraft during flight via a fuel scoop, but it can also be purchased at refueling stations.\n",
    "Hydrogen Fuel Refinery": "A hydrogen fuel refinery is an industrial process plant where hydrogen is refined into hydrogen fuel. Hydrogen refineries are mostly located on orbital platforms around hydrogen-rich gas giants.\n",
    "HyperClay": "Found on Hyperion (Fora III), HyperClay is a fine, red-colored dust-like particle that was released into the atmosphere when the planet was terraformed. It is readily picked up by wind and sticks easily to most surfaces, and can also cause respiratory issues if inhaled. HyperClay storms are a perpetual problem for residents of Hyperion.\n",
    "Hyperion (Fora III)": "Hyperion (Fora III) is the third planet from the sun of the Fora system, United Empire of Earth (UEE), and is the system's only populated world. In 2316, the Aether Worldbuilding Corporation started terraforming operations on Fora III, but abandoned the project in 2319 when the company unexpectedly folded. When a jump point was discovered in Fora's neighboring system Banshee to the Banu system Yulin in 2463, there was a rush to terraform the planet. However, an accident during the terraforming process vaporized part of the mantle, creating a fine red powder that dispersed into the atmosphere and plunged Hyperion into a perpetual, planet-wide dust storm. The project was abandoned. Today, Hyperion is used as a de facto home base for many pirates and smugglers.\n",
    "ICC Stellar Surveyors": "The Stellar Surveyors are a group of people who work under the auspices of the Imperial Cartography Center (ICC) to examine and explore newly discovered worlds and other locations. Their work is essential to the United Empire of Earth (UEE) government in establishing maps and boundaries and in the discovery of any potential resources. Most Stellar Surveyors are invited to work for the ICC based on their skill and experience in the public and private sectors. The official motto of the group is \u201cCharting the Way Ahead.\u201d\n",
    "Ice Mining": "Ice mining is a process by which ice is collected from asteroids and other celestial bodies beyond a planetary system\u2019s frost line. Mined water ice is generally used to provide water to spacecraft or to locations that suffer from a lack of water. Ice of other kinds, such as carbon dioxide or ammonia, can be commercially sold or used for research purposes.\n",
    "Idris I": "Idris I is a terrestrial planet in the Idris system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Closest in orbit to its system's sun, heat and radiation have eroded the planet's crust and mantle down to its solid iron core. Its surface is covered in extensive mare-like plains and heavy cratering. The largest of these craters has a diameter of roughly 1600 kilometers, and is surrounded on all sides by a concentric mountainous ring.\n",
    "Idris II": "Idris II is the second planet from the sun of the Idris system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). It has a dense, volatile, high-pressure atmosphere that consists mainly of carbon dioxide. A layer of highly-reflective clouds of sulfuric acid envelops the planet, preventing its surface from being viewed by the naked eye. While there is evidence of extensive geologic activity in the past, volcanic eruptions are now infrequent.\n",
    "Idris III": "Idris III is an ocean planet in the Idris system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Although its location suggests it would be a good candidate for terraforming, it is covered in oceans of hot, high-density fluid made up of a mix of water with ammonia and other volatiles that make it far from ideal. Research probes sent to investigate the planet have often fallen victim to its dangerous seas.\n",
    "Idris System": "The Idris system is a planetary system in the United Empire of Earth (UEE), made up of an F-type main sequence star, four terrestrial planets, and a protoplanet. Discovered in 2493, the system experienced significant economic expansion when the United Planets of Earth (UPE) declared it a Recommended Growth Center in 2533. Because it shares a jump point with the Elysium system, it was the site of multiple battles in the First and Second Tevarin wars. The Tevarin surprise invasion of Idris in 2542 was the first in a series of events that helped propel Ivar Messer I to power.\n",
    "Idris V": "Idris V is a protoplanet in the Idris system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Once dense with valuable minerals, the UEE government and various companies systematically strip-mined Idris V throughout the 26th and 27th centuries. Its resources were significantly depleted. Pits and furrows left by mining equipment scar its surface, and its abandoned mining facilities are sporadically occupied by squatters and criminals.\n",
    "Ignis (Pyro 5a)": "Ignis is the innermost moon of the gas giant Pyro V, Pyro system. The canyons and dry riverbeds on its surface suggest that liquid water once flowed there in the distant past. Its frigid average temperature and deadly atmosphere of sulfur dioxide creates an unfriendly environment for those who lack proper protective equipment. Nonetheless, the moon sometimes sees visitors seeking to resupply their air reserves thanks to the small amount of oxygen in the atmosphere.\n",
    "Illyana Messer VI": "Illyana Messer VI (2631-2697) was Imperator of the United Empire of Earth (UEE) from 2662 to 2697 after the assassination of her father, Corsen Messer V and brother Gammon. Under her rule, the UEE lessened some of its propaganda practices, allowing news organizations to criticize aspects of the government without retribution. Near the end of her life, she named her youngest son Samuel as her successor over his brother Galor in order to avoid a power struggle between her children. In spite of this precaution, her niece Astrid seized the throne upon Illyana\u2019s death in 2697, sparking a four year stretch of armed conflicts between family loyalists.\n",
    "Illyana Sharrad": "Illyana Sharrad (2897 - present) is a Human politician and the High-Secretary of the United Empire of Earth (UEE) from 2942 to 2950. Appointed by ImperatorKelos Costigan, she first took office in 2942 after a two decade career as a civil infrastructure consultant. It was her work exposing a major corruption scheme centered around private firms bidding for public works projects that first drew the attention of the Imperator's office. As High-Secretary, she has advocated for increased funding for infrastructure repair and improvement, worked to close loopholes in Imperial Grant Policy, and helped to oust multiple officials for corruption. She announced her intention to run for Imperator in late 2949 and succeeded in becoming one of five final candidates in the April 2950 Secondary Vote. A member of the Universalist party, her platform included the Jump Start plan to increase infrastructure spending for achievable local projects in an effort to create employment opportunities, freezing and re-evaluating Synthworld funding, and the Active Engagement program to increase civic engagement. Anonymous attack ads criticizing her budget plan released just before the Secondary Vote pulled some Universalist support from her in favor of fellow party member Titus Costigan.\n",
    "Imperator's Day": "Imperator\u2019s Day is a United Empire of Earth (UEE) holiday commemorating the unification of all Humans under one government, celebrated annually on July twelfth. It was established as a holiday in 2380 under the name Council Day to recognize the initial council that led the United Nations of Earth (UNE). When the United Planets of Earth (UPE) was founded in 2523, it became Tribunal Day, and in 2546 after Ivar Messer I established the UEE, it took on its current name. There have been recent petitions to change the name of the holiday again to reflect the diminished political importance of the Imperator role in the modern governance of the UEE.\n",
    "Imperial Arts Foundation": "The Imperial Arts Foundation (IAF) is a nonprofit charitable organization located on Green (Ellis III) that provides funding and resources to artists and arts programs in the United Empire of Earth (UEE). It was founded in 2811 by Marana River (2788-2887). Every year, the IAF awards grants and fellowships to artists who work with a wide variety of forms, including music, sculpture, dance, performance, digital media, and writing.\nAfter graduating from Aydo Polytechnic with a degree in sculpture, heiress Marana River was able to work comfortably as an artist thanks to her family's wealth. Many of her friends, however, struggled to make art and support themselves at the same time. This difference in circumstances pushed River to research how she could provide artists like her friends with enough money to concentrate on their work without worrying about paying rent or obtaining basic necessities.\nEnlisting the help of her parents, River secured initial funding to hold a gala, to which she invited local businesses, government officials, celebrities, and wealthy friends. The gala was a success; in its first year, the organization raised roughly 3 million UEC. With these funds, River registered her new charity under the name Green Foundation for the Arts and hired her first employees. She continued to hold other fundraiser events alongside her annual gala, and after six years of fundraising, established an endowment of 400 million UEC. The charity awarded grants only to new artists on Green for eleven years. When it opened a second branch on Aremis (Vega II) in 2829, it was renamed the Imperial Arts Foundation and amended its mission to support new artists in all parts of the UEE.\nThe IAF sponsors two major events every year: the Green Gala and the Folk Arts and Music Fair. The Green Gala, held at the Green Museum of Art, is a red-carpet, invite-only event used to generate funds for the IAF. Celebrities and philanthropists attend alongside IAF grant recipients selected by an independent committee of arts peers. Each gala is assigned a theme to set the tone for attendees' formal dress. The Folk Arts and Music Fair, held on multiple planets on a rotating basis, is an arts festival showcasing traditional and non-traditional arts unique to each planet in the UEE. The first fair, held on Saisei (Centauri III) in 2847, honored traditional Saisei instrument craft.\nIn addition to grants, the IAF gives out awards to artists who demonstrate outstanding potential. Those early in their careers are given the River's Promise Award and a monetary prize. The Eminence Award is given to artists who have benefited from IAF grants and have gone on to achieve prominence in their chosen discipline. Lastly, supporters who have donated to the IAF, without whom the charity would be unable to continue its mission, are recognized with a Patron of the Arts Award.\n",

    "Ivar Messer I": "Ivar Messer (2516-2592) was the first Imperator of the United Empire of Earth (UEE). He was a Captain in the United Planets of EarthArmy 112th Infantry Battalion when he distinguished himself in the First Tevarin War (2541-2546) during Operation Nemesis and in the Battle of Idris IV, when he took command after the death of his captain and led his troops to victory. The government capitalized off his image as a brave and charismatic officer in an advertising campaign to recruit soldiers. After the war, he utilized this to gain political influence, securing a position in the Tribunal as High-General. He then leveraged public fervor against the Atrocity at Jata to create the new governmental position of Prime Citizen. During an emergency election held 15 December 2546, he was elected to the office he helped enact. He went on to completely restructure the government: first dissolving the Tribunal, then renaming the UPE the United Empire of Earth, and then declaring himself Imperator in early 2547. He continued to enact sweeping changes, accruing power and further entrenching his position. Ivar married Corporate CTO Delia Hassan in 2571 and had one son, Deacon, shortly after, who would ascend to Imperator after his father's death in 2592.\n",
    "J Harris Arnold": "Jude \u201cJ\u201d Harris Arnold (2742 - 2853) was the lead designer and founder of Anvil Aerospace. Born in 2742, he was the only son of Pax Harris and Ndilimeke Arnold, real estate moguls on Terra (Terra III). He graduated from the Astronautics Laboratory within the Martian Institute of Space Technology (MIST), where he was first exposed to the works of deceased spacecraft designer Leonard Casse, whose portfolio strongly influenced Arnold's future designs. In 2772, he founded Anvil Aerospace, which went on to become one of the United Empire of Earth (UEE) military's premier shipbuilders. Arnold insisted on personally approving every part of his vehicles' designs while he served as CEO. His policies of profit-sharing with his workers and fostering the talents of promising employees at Anvil led to the launch of many successful careers, and made him a popular figure in the often cutthroat spacecraft manufacturing industry. He died of old age in 2853.\nArnold began his career as a junior designer at Aegis Dynamics in 2763, where he would eventually be assigned to assist on Project Monitor, developing the vehicle which would become the Hammerhead. A design of his was selected to be made into one of six prototypes, but it was not ultimately delivered to the UEE Navy (UEEN) after it failed early flight tests. Arnold became demoralized with his job after a lack of feedback from his supervisors, especially after repeated rejections of new designs following his failed prototype. In his spare time, he began to sketch ideas for ships based on the creations of his favorite designer, Leonard Casse.\nIt became apparent to Arnold by 2770 that he had no path forward at Aegis. He decided to quit his position and accepted a seed loan from his parents to start his own ship manufacturing company, which he planned to operate based on the flat organization style that was used at Casse Aerospace. Under this style of management, everyone's opinions would be given equal weight no matter their status, with all final decisions left to Arnold. Although this would cause a long development process, Arnold felt that worker satisfaction would lead to a stronger final product.\nIn 2772, construction on his new shipbuilding facility in Nova Kyiv, Terra was complete. Arnold named the new company Anvil Aerospace in reference to former MIST professor Robert Calvin's famous assertion from his book Mechanisms of Empire that military spending \"...fuels the furnaces of expansion and strikes the anvils of innovation.\" Within the first year, Arnold and his team had created a prototype fighter called the Osprey. As an homage to Casse, Arnold included signature elements from Casse's ships such as curved wings and the open circle signet in his own designs.\nUsing connections he had made during his time at Aegis, Arnold showed the prototype to a small gathering of Navy officials. The ship proved to be a hit and the Navy placed Anvil's first ever order. As word spread of the new manufacturer's successful entry into the military market, it caught the eye of the holding firm that owned the rights to the Casse Aerospace portfolio, which sued Arnold for copyright infringement. Facing a potentially devastating lawsuit, Arnold chose to settle the case by purchasing all of Casse Aerospace's portfolio for an undisclosed sum. Arnold released a public statement that Anvil would continue to utilize Casse's signature elements in their ships as an ode to a talented designer who died far too young.\nAfter the events of the anti-Messer revolution in 2792, the UEE stripped Aegis Dynamics of most of its contracts due to its strong association with the Messer regime. As a part of the UEE Navy's defensive restructure focused on protecting and serving the civilian population, Anvil Aerospace was approached by Vice Admiral Galen Whishaw of the UEEN Research & Development Division, who offered Anvil a direct contract to develop a brand new ship. The result was the U4A-3 Terrapin, a design that Arnold had been working on with lead engineer Allegra Wilsing. The successful deployment of that ship in 2796 helped to make Arnold and his company an indispensable part of the UEE's defense. Over the next few decades, Arnold personally supervised the development of all Anvil's military ships, most notably the F7A Hornet, which replaced the Aegis Avenger as the UEE's standard front-line fighter.\nIn semi-retirement by the early 2840s, Arnold nevertheless still required that all parts of a ship's development be approved by him. On a trip to MacArthur (Kilian V) in 2850, he is reported to have been evaluating changes made to Anvil's many projects on his mobiGlas in between meetings with UEEN leadership. He served as a guest lecturer at MIST in 2851 and was invited to return the following year, but he declined, citing a desire to return \"home\" to the Anvil offices in Nova Kyiv. He died at his desk in 2853.\n",
    "Jalan (Elysium IV)": "Jalan is the most populous planet in the Elysium system, United Empire of Earth (UEE), and is the home planet of Tevarin. Originally called Kaleeth, it was annexed by the United Planets of Earth (UPE) at the end of the First Tevarin War (2541 - 2546) and colonized by Humans, displacing many Tevarin. Warlord Corath\u2019thal launched the Second Tevarin War (2603 - 2610) to retake the lost planet, but his efforts ultimately failed. In 2610, it was recognized by the UEE Senate and renamed Jalan. The oldest known Tevarin structures that survived both Tevarin wars and the Purge can be found here; most notably, the Rijoran Temple in Gemma. In 2946, one of its current Senators, Suj Kossi, became the first Tevarin elected to the Senate.\n",
    "Janis Rezaian": "Janis Rezaian (2469-2550) was High-Secretary of the United Planets of Earth from 2539 to 2546. Along with High-Advocate Mauricio Tusk, she publicly criticized High-General Ivar Messer for his unwillingness to negotiate with his colleagues on the Tribunal. When Messer obtained the office of Prime Citizen, he dismantled the Tribunal. Rezaian ran for Senator of Vann (Croshaw III) in 2548, but lost to her opponent. She died of natural causes at age 81.\n",
    "Janna Thurville": "Janna Thurville (b. 2895) is the Senator of Severus (Kiel III), Kiel system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). The oldest daughter of former Governor of Severus Joona Tzur and concert pianist Xin Yi Tzur, she was elected as one of the first Senators of Severus alongside Centralist Hideo Uto when it was recognized in 2937. A member of the Transitionalist party, she supports the decentralization of governmental power and its delegation to the UEE's most economically successful planets. She advocates for increased spending on education and the arts, and is opposed to excessive military spending.\n",
    "Janus": "Janus was an artificial intelligence (AI) program designed to monitor and pilot the long-haul colony spacecraft Artemis, launched in 2232. Prominent AI researcher Dr. Carol Zahir began work on the program that would become Janus in 2201. Zahir spent the rest of her career growing her team of researchers and bringing Janus to life. Though she ultimately succeeded in creating the most complex artificial intelligence yet developed, she passed away two years before its completion. The Janus AI was lost alongside its ship when the Artemis fell out of contact with Earth (Sol III) in 2237 and disappeared. Rumors that Janus purposely caused the disappearance of the Artemis circulated in Human news after the ship vanished, though there was no evidence to support this claim. Many cite this negative speculation as one of the reasons Humans have done little research on artificial intelligence since the early 23rd century.\n",
    "Jata": "Jata is the most populous city of Cestulus (Davien II). Because the planet\u2019s atmosphere is thin, Jata is largely located under enormous, complex biodomes kept habitable by a system of air production facilities that help supplement the oxygen supply. It became the United Empire of Earth\u2019s (UEE) main center for trade with the Banu after Banu-Human First Contact in 2438. Although Banu-specific trade waned when Humans discovered systems closer to Banu territory, the city has remained a hub of commerce and shipping, partially due to the presence of major spacecraft manufacturer Aegis Dynamics\u2019 main headquarters. Jata has often been the setting of Human political upheavals, such as the 2529 Unified Currency Riots and the 2546 Atrocity at Jata, the first in a series of terrorist bombings that led to the implementation of Ivar Messer I\u2019sPrime Citizen plan.\n",
    "Javelin": "The Javelin is a destroyer created by Aegis Dynamics for the United Empire of Earth Navy (UEEN). Designed as a modular spacecraft, the UEEN could make major conversions to the Javelin for different roles rather than constructing individual specialized capital ships.

McCleary left his position in 2931 to launch Galactic Gear, a show that examines and reviews spacecraft through often outlandish means. The show was sold in 2945 to Voyager Direct after years of ratings success and was relaunched and rebranded as Galactic Tour in 2946. McCleary left the show shortly after, and returned to racing commentary until accepting a contract to host Whitley\u2019s Guide in 2950.\n",

    "Joona Tzur": "Joona Tzur (b. 2852) is the former Governor of Severus (Kiel III), Kiel system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Elected in 2903, he established a program to revitalize Severus' economy by selling the planet's abandoned military infrastructure to corporations in search of low-cost real estate. The strategy paid off when numerous aerospace corporations took Tzur up on his offer. Tzur reinvested the money into the creation of green spaces and other public places, creating more jobs for the residents and improving the previously blighted landscape. In 2913, thanks to Tzur's overtures, the board of the Intergalactic Aerospace Expo elected to make a permanent home on Severus. Tzur completed his term as Governor in 2915.\n",

It was nicknamed Judecca after a frozen lake depicted in an ancient Human story that eternally imprisons traitors.\n",
    "Juliet Maupin": "Juliet Maupin (2747 - 2862) was a weapons and scanner engineer. She began her career at Aegis Dynamics as a machinist in 2766, eventually transferring to the ships team on Cestulus (Davien II) in 2772. There, she worked her way up to lead engineer and led the team responsible for the 2783 revamp of the Retaliator bomber. Following that success, she was enlisted by the United Empire of Earth (UEE) military to produce a new line of powerful and advanced weapons for the Messer government. Maupin fled with her family to the Corel system after the events of the anti-Messer revolution for fear of being associated with the former regime. A crate of Maupin's prototypes that never made it to the Kilian system for testing was discovered in a Cestulus warehouse in 2911 by Dalton Colabello, who went on to use them as the basis for the debut line of weapons for his new company Apocalypse Arms.\n",
    "Jump Point": "A jump point is a point in space that marks the opening of a traversable wormhole (jump tunnel) that tunnels through interspace and opens to another location, often a different solar system. In their natural state, jump points are nearly invisible to the naked eye. Their discovery has allowed civilizations to cross vast distances in the universe. Known, stabilized jump points are marked off with large structures and usually patrolled to ensure that they have been legally and safely traversed.\n",
    "Jump Tunnel": "A jump tunnel (traversable wormhole) is a naturally-occurring topological feature in spacetime that effectively allows for superliminal travel through interspace across vast distances. Jump tunnels allow spacefaring civilizations to easily and quickly travel to other planetary systems that would normally only be accessible after years, sometimes decades of quantum travel. Though jump tunnels can be stabilized and often have incredibly long lives, they are known to collapse without warning.\n",
    "Jumping Lime (Yar Fruit)": "The jumping lime, also called the Yar lime or the Yar fruit, is a sweet, sour, astringent fruit that grows from a cactus that naturally mutated on Yar (Centauri II) some time after the planet's terraformation. Discovered in 2450, the fruit was named for the ease with which it falls off its parent plant and clings to clothing and skin. It was domesticated as a crop plant in the early 26th Century. Wild specimens can still be found in Yar's Red Desert, but they are not as sweet as the domesticated variety.\nThe jumping cactus (cylindropuntia acerbus), the plant from which the jumping lime grows, is a mutation of the Earth (Sol III)-native plant jumping cholla (cylindropuntia fulgida). A tree-like plant, it has branches that grow near the base of the trunk, each one covered in small, hair-like spines with tiny hooks on the end. It grows to heights of roughly three meters. The branches are susceptible to overgrowth during especially wet years, and will prematurely die unless pruned or supported. Rows of jumping cacti with their branches tied to stakes are a common sight in Yar's former mining towns.\nAt the end of the wet season, a vivid purple and green flower sprouts from the end of each branch of the cactus. If a flower is pollinated by hand or by night-flying insects, the petals will wither and it will develop into a spiny, round, purplish fruit. Branches that don't produce fruit tend to drop off the plant and dry in the desert sun. After four weeks of growth, farmers remove the branches with stunted fruit to concentrate the plant's resources on the branches growing big, healthy fruit. At eight weeks, the barbed, leathery skin of the fruit turns green and is ready to be harvested. Workers traditionally wear protective gear as the spines can pierce skin. The fruit must be de-spined and peeled in order to access the sweet, very tart, astringent flesh.\nCylindropuntia acerbus is indigenous to Yar and takes easily to any planet with deserts or dry forests. The Red Desert is home to a number of thick forests of the plant that may range over many hectares. It is common to see local fauna with the fruit attached to their hides, which is the main way the plant's seeds are spread in the wild. Some desert animals have adapted to be able to cope with the plant's spines and will break open the unripe fruit to consume it during the dry season. Although the fruit does have hydrating properties, its juice is astringent enough that it often causes a feeling of false dehydration. Yar locals warn against eating the fruit unless another source of water is nearby.\nJumping limes are appreciated for their intense flavor and aroma, though many prefer to eat them cooked rather than raw. When they are roasted, some of the astringency decreases and the sugars caramelize, transforming the flesh from very tannic and sour to bright and acidic. Yar locals will peel, chop, and stew the fruit with sweetener until it's completely broken down into pulp, and then strain it and use the liquid to make jelly. The resulting product is very sour and sweet, slightly bitter, and leaves a dry feeling in the mouth after it's consumed.\nWhile Humans who don't live on Yar largely consider the jumping lime jelly an acquired taste, it is popular among Banu for its complex flavor profile. Formerly economically depressed towns on Yar have experienced positive growth in recent years thanks to exports to the Protectorate or sales to passing Soulis.\n",

Although it is not habited and appears to be deserted, the Xi'an government forbids any spacecraft from landing on the planet's surface. Scans taken in the area have shown evidence of gunfire, suggesting that the Xi'an military might use K'ya.k'uing as a training ground or weapons testing area.\n",
    "K.yuk'o (Kai'pua IV)": "K.yuk'o (Kai'pua IV) is the fourth planet from the sun of the Kai'pua system, Xi'an Empire (SaoXy'an), and is a gas dwarf. Since its rocky core and diffuse atmosphere have nearly identical properties to those of neighboring planet Kyu'kyu (Kai'pua III), some astronomers speculate that they may have originally formed in the same region before drifting away from each other. One hypothesis suggests that a rogue planet sliced through the system and pulled K.yuk'o out of its original orbit.\n",

Blanketed in a thick, high-pressure atmosphere of sulfur-dioxide, K.yuy'a'than's surface is extremely dangerous, and the Xi'an government appears to have left the world alone. However, multiple Human witnesses claim to have seen bright flashes just underneath the cloud layer. While none of their accounts have so far been confirmed, this mysterious activity has been a recurring subject on the spectrum show Untold Tales.\n",
    "Kabal Cluster Alpha": "The Kabal cluster alpha is an asteroid cluster found in the Kabal system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Rich in minerals, there is evidence that the Tevarin mined ores and metals there, but stopped when they abandoned the system at some point before 2541. They left some of their equipment behind, giving archaeologists a glimpse of what Tevarin technology was like before the First Tevarin War (2541 - 2546).\n",
    "Kabal I": "Kabal I is a protoplanet in the Kabal system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Thought to have formed alongside the system's terrestrial planets, it has a differentiated interior, suggesting that at some point in the past it may have been a dwarf planet. Craters on its surface suggest that it suffered impacts that destroyed its once-rounded shape.\n",
    "Kabal II": "Kabal II is the second planet from the sun of the Kabal system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). A terrestrial desert world, its position in the system's green band would make it an excellent candidate for terraforming if not for the ancient abandoned Tevarin cities on neighboring planet Kabal III. In order to protect the integrity of this archaeologically valuable site, colonization of all planets in Kabal is currently prohibited. Shubin Interstellar has repeatedly petitioned the UEE Senate to open up development of Kabal II under the argument that there are no ruins there to preserve.\n",
    "Kabal III": "Kabal III is the third and furthest planet from the sun of the Kabal system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). A naturally inhabitable world, it was colonized by the Tevarin and then believed to have been abandoned en masse at some point before the First Tevarin War (2541 - 2546). Archaeologists have yet to uncover the reason behind their departure due to the loss of most Tevarin records during the Purge in the immediate aftermath of the Second Tevarin War (2603 - 2610). The cities found on Kabal III are the best-preserved examples of pre-Human contact Tevarin architecture and goods in the known universe.\n",
    "Kabal System": "The Kabal system is a planetary system in the United Empire of Earth (UEE), composed of an F-type main sequence star, a protoplanet, two terrestrial planets, and an asteroid cluster. In 2941, stellar surveyor Usuni Colo of the Imperial Cartography Center discovered a jump point to the system from Leir. At first, it appeared that the system was empty, but Tevarin cities abandoned sometime before the First Tevarin War (2541 - 2546) were found on Kabal III. Colonization of the system is prohibited to protect the integrity of this important archaeological site.\n",
    "Kai'pua System": "The Kai'pua system is a planetary system in the Xi'an Empire (SaoXy'an) that consists of a K-type main sequence star, two terrestrial planets, and two gas dwarfs. One of the most important locations in the Xi'an Empire, it is the spiritual center of Li'tova, the central code of ethics and main religion for the Xi'an people. It was discovered at the end of the First Imperial Age (MXY I.0 - I.14680 / SEY 19668 - 878 BCE), when the final Ru'a Emperor Se'ang voluntarily renounced the throne and House Xy.\u014d ascended as the new Imperial House. When the second planet from the system's sun was found to have a planetary rotation period as long as 100 Modern Xi'an Years (MXY), it was declared significant to Li'tova, named R.aip'u\u0101ng, and terraformed into a planet-wide garden.\n",
    "Kallis Belt Alpha": "The Kallis belt alpha is an asteroid belt in the developing Kallis system. Densely packed with planetesimals, asteroids, dust, and gasses, matter in the belt is constantly pulled out of orbit by the larger bodies forming on its outer edges. The unusually high amount of motion this activity creates poses a hazard for any ships passing through the area.\n",
    "Kallis Belt Beta": "The Kallis belt beta is the second asteroid belt from the sun of the developing Kallis system. Less dense than its sibling belt, it is primarily composed of dust grains and small asteroids that may be remnants from the formation of Kallis IV and Kallis V. In 2931, a group of art smugglers from Bremen attempted to conceal themselves in the dust of the beta belt before being apprehended by a UEE Army patrol ship.\n",
    "Kallis I": "Kallis I is a protoplanet in the developing Kallis system. A small mass of matter, it is believed that this protoplanet will eventually coalesce with nearby planetesimals and become a planet. Recent changes in its orbit have pushed it closer to its sun, leading to speculation that it may break apart if this migration continues.\n",
    "Kallis II": "Kallis II is a terrestrial planet in the developing Kallis system. While it shares an orbit with Kallis III, it passes slightly closer to its sun during perihelion and has thus been designated as the system's second planet. As it pulls in material from the nearby asteroid belts, it may eventually become massive enough to subsume its sibling planet. It is currently somewhat smaller than Kallis III, but may grow much larger given enough time.\n",
    "Kallis III": "Kallis III is a terrestrial planet in the developing Kallis system that shares an orbit with another planet, Kallis II. More massive than its sibling planet, it is also accruing matter at a higher rate, and is expected to continue increasing in size. Observing scientists believe that it may one day grow large enough to subsume Kallis II.\n",
    "Kallis IV": "Kallis IV is the fourth planet from the sun of the developing Kallis system. Due to its position in the green band, current size, and robust volcanic activity, it seems to be evolving into an Earth-like planet. Survey teams on OB Station Gryphon monitor Kallis IV around the clock and unpiloted drones are constantly collecting data. A great deal of valuable information has been discovered thanks to this long-term study. However, the planet is not expected to finish forming for many thousands of years.\n",
    "Kallis IX": "Kallis IX is a dwarf planet in the developing Kallis system, and is the ninth planet from its sun. Frigidly cold, its surface is marked with active cryovolcanoes that spew ice and water into the ammonia-rich atmosphere. The planet came to fame in the 2943 Tonya Oriel story Lost Generation, where it appeared as the final resting place of a passenger from the missing long-haul colony ship Artemis. OB Station Gryphon faced an influx of tourists wanting to visit the site, not knowing that the story was fictional.\n",
    "Kallis System": "Kallis is an unclaimed, developing planetary system in its accretion phase that consists of a G-type main sequence star, a protoplanet, five terrestrial planets, a gas giant, an ice giant, a dwarf planet, and two asteroid belts. Discovered in 2921 by the staff of the OB Station Chimera in the Oso system, it was placed under the protection of the Fair Chance Act despite a lack of sentient life in order to give scientists an opportunity to study a planetary system in its infancy. In 2935, over a hundred people fell victim to a scammer selling land deeds in the system under the misconception that the planets would take only a few more years to finish growing. It is estimated that the system's growth will not conclude for another million Standard Earth Years.\n",
    "Kallis V": "Kallis V is a terrestrial planet in the developing Kallis system. The fifth planet from its sun, it lacks geological activity and appears to have reached the final stages of its formation. It is surrounded by a wide disk of planetesimals and dust that are likely to be remains from its earlier stages of growth. Two especially large objects growing in the disk may possibly be coalescing into moons.\n",
    "Kallis VI": "Kallis VI is a terrestrial planet in the developing Kallis system, and is the sixth planet from its sun. Covered in an ocean of molten rock, it is still in an early stage of formation, and its crust is not expected to cool down enough to allow for the formation of continents for many millennia. The high amount of carbon present on the planet has led scientists to believe that when it finishes forming, it will be devoid of water.\n",
    "Kallis VII": "Kallis VII is the seventh planet from the sun of the Kallis system. A young gas giant, it formed in the outer parts of the system during the star's stellar nebula phase, where it collected enough mass to attract huge amounts of hydrogen and helium gas over the relatively rapid period of about 200,000 years. It later migrated to its current position, possibly subsuming or displacing other objects in its path. In 2952, United Empire of Earth Army officials filed a request to open a refueling station over Kallis VII, citing the cost of importing fuel and the late stage of the planet's development.\n",
    "Kamposi Magnus": "The kamposi magnus was a tusked aquatic animal that inhabited Kampos (Ellis IV) until roughly 500,000 SEY ago. Kamposi was an omnivorous apex predator with a dense, solid, compact skeleton adapted for the high-gravity, high-pressure environment of Kampos\u2019 deep oceans. Though the exact cause of its extinction is unknown, it is hypothesized from fossil records that an underwater volcanic eruption may have triggered an extinction event that disrupted the kamposi\u2019s food chain. The Governors Council of Ellis IV chose to name its planet Kampos after the kamposi magnus upon receiving recognition from the UEE Senate in 2562.\nIn 2488, colonist Gary Yahontov of Ellis IV in the United Empire of Earth (UEE) discovered a large fossilized skull while dredging along the shore of his settlement. Yahontov used it as a piece of decoration in his yard for six years. Vira Kamposi, an academic passing through to study gravitational effects on local planet life, stole the fossil in 2493 and transported it via spacecraft to her former teachers at the University of Rhetor. Members of the paleontology department identified it as an undiscovered species and dispatched a research team to Ellis IV. A complete fossilized skeleton was discovered in 2496, 57 kilometers from Yahontov\u2019s home. Already nicknamed kamposi by the team, the researchers appended magnus to the name after the skeleton measured 11 meters long. The first herd of kamposi was discovered in 2543, challenging early conjecture that the kamposi was solitary.\nWhen she returned to Ellis IV in 2494, Kamposi was arrested and convicted of theft, after which she served six months in prison. Yahontov successfully sued the University of Rhetor in 2501 for repatriation of the skull. It sat in his yard until his death in 2536, upon which it was confiscated by the government of Ellis IV.\nReconstructions of the kamposi reveal that it could grow up to 12 meters in length and typically weighed about 40 tonnes. It had four eyes, two pairs of jointed mandibles around its mouth, and a pair of broad tusks on either side of its head. The teeth along the inside of its jaw and analysis of its bones indicate that it consumed both meat and vegetable matter. The mandibles likely facilitated quick consumption of prey, and the tusks probably aided in dredging up bottom-dwellers and uprooting plants from the ocean bed.\nAbout 500,000 years ago, a supervolcano located near Kampos\u2019 equator erupted underwater, causing planetwide tsunamis, substantial seismic shifts, and mass extinctions. The kamposi vanished from the fossil record shortly after the eruption took place. Analysis of kamposi tusks from several thousand years prior to this event indicate that there were no long-term stressors that might have contributed to its demise\nThe kamposi is considered a symbol of Kampos. Mostly covered in ocean, Kampos is home to a wide spectrum of aquatic life. The kamposi was one of the first major discoveries to come out of Kampos in its colony days. Possibly because it received a moderate amount of fame in the popular media after the first academic publication on it nicknamed the kamposi \"lords of the deep,\" early inhabitants of Ellis IV embraced it as an emblem of their planet\u2019s oceans and unique biodiversity.\nIn 2945, a scale replica of the kampos skull first discovered by Gary Yahontov debuted in the Puglisi Collection. It remains the bestselling Puglisi item on Kampos.\n",
    "Kavische": "The kavische is a cactus hybrid that originated on Yar (Centauri II) and is now found throughout the planet. After Yar was terraformed in the mid-2800s, numerous plants and cacti were seeded onto the world. A few cycles later, a new hybrid that would come to be known as the kavische was discovered successfully growing across the Red Desert. Due to its rosy coloration and beautiful night-blooming flowers, the kavische is popular among succulent and cactus enthusiasts.\nIn the years before it was terraformed, Yar was a desert planet with a very thin hydrogen-oxygen atmosphere; enough to support some forms of life, but not enough to allow Humans to live on the surface without supplemental air. It remained a planet that only attracted botanical and entomological researchers until a vein of titanium was found in the Shunkai Mountains in 2839. Upon receiving this report, the United Empire of Earth (UEE) authorized minimal terraformation of the world to help facilitate and encourage extraction of the planet's resources.\nMany plants that had originated on Earth (Sol III) were seeded on Yar as a part of the terraformation process. Cereus cacti were exceptionally suited to the planet, propagating themselves without Human assistance as soon as the atmosphere was deemed breathable. However, instead of reproducing only within the cereus genus as expected, the cacti began to hybridize with local plants. Among these cactus seedlings was a new type of hybrid, dubbed \"kavische\" cactus after the plateau upon which it was discovered.\nThe kavische proved vigorous, even in the inhospitable Red Desert, an arid region so vast it is visible from planetary orbit. It took on the cylindrical appearance, towering height, and flowering cycle of its cereus parent, and the red coloration and thicker, sharper spines of its Yar parent, the hematic cactus. Over the long term, it outperformed both its ancestors, eventually coming to dominate the landscape.\nUpon reaching maturity, a kavische will put out a large flower that ranges in color from white to orange to red to purple, depending on the region in which it grows and the variety of plant. This heavily-scented flower blooms only for one night. Bats introduced from Earth and giant Yar moths pollinate the blossoms, which then close and transform into a water-rich fruit. Desert birds, rodents, and other animals consume the fallen fruit and spread the seeds over a wide area. The dropped seeds lay dormant until a rare rainfall occurs, at which point they sprout, establish roots, and begin to grow. Fully mature kavische can reach almost 2.5 meters in height.\nThe people of Yar consider the kavische cactus a symbol of thriving in a harsh environment. Homesteads are sometimes heavily planted with the kavische, both as a deterrent to would-be trespassers and as a point of Yar pride. Prospectors planning to search the Red Desert for potential resources to mine are known to carry dried pieces of the kavische with them for good luck. Locals also have been known to create decorative jewelry or embellish their clothing with the spines.\nKavische cuttings are a common export from Yar to plant collectors. The cuttings take easily to standard cactus or succulent conditions and will root themselves in sandy soil with the application of very little water. Some dwarf varieties of kavische have been bred outside of Yar and have become popular house plants. Dwarf kavische that produce showier and more colorful flowers have recently appeared in plant markets thanks to the efforts of hobby growers. The low maintenance and durability of the plant have also made it popular among students.\n",
    "Kedsu Reef": "The Kedsu Reef is a space station composed of derelict ships and abandoned military platforms located in the Hadrian system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Founded in 2881 by former Banu indenture Delilah Havers, the construction of Kedsu was inspired by Banu-style flotilla marketplaces. It is the main hub of commerce in the Hadrian system, and its markets stock goods from all over Human, Xi\u2019an, and Banu space.\n",
    "Keeger Belt (Nyx Belt Beta)": "The Keeger belt (Nyx belt beta) is the outermost asteroid belt in the Nyx system. Asteroids in the Keeger belt are more thinly-distributed than those of the Glaciem ring (Nyx belt alpha) and orbit the system\u2019s sun at a lesser velocity. Some of the larger asteroids still bear signs of past mining activity. The United Empire of Earth (UEE) Advocacy believes that there may be criminal strongholds hidden within the belt, but, owing to the unclaimed status of the system, none have been officially confirmed.\n",
    "Keene (Kilian VII)": "Keene is a terraformed terrestrial planet located seventh from the star of the Kilian system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). A civilian world, Keene is home to many offices and showrooms for spacecraft manufacturers, along with military-aligned corporations and independent businesses. A majority of the supplies needed by the UEE Navybase at MacArthur are manufactured on Keene. The population spiked after the Battle of Orion forced Humans to flee the Vanduul and seek the protection of the military. A second wave of refugees occurred again after the Fall of Virgil.\n",
    "Kellar Lench": "Dr. Kellar Lench (2514 - 2573) was the first Human to locate the Elysium system and the Tevarin civilization in 2541. A research scientist, his first job after obtaining his doctorate was with the New Horizons Research Institute, a subsidiary of the Hathor Group. After a solo assignment on Yar (Centauri II) that lasted over 250 days, Lench abandoned his post, resigned from New Horizons, and visited Fujin City on Saisei (Centauri III). On 15 November 2541, he discovered a jump point in Centauri that led to a planetary system teeming with life. His decision to share his findings with the United Planets of Earth (UPE) led to first contact with the Tevarin, which would trigger the First Tevarin War (2541 - 2546). Lench went on to become a lecturer at the Martian Institute of Space Technology (MIST), where he taught physics until his death from complications related to alcoholism in 2573.\n",
    "Kellar's Run": "Kellar's Run is a 2931 intersystem spacecraft chase that started in the outlaw space station Spider in the Cathcart system when Dean Kellar shot and killed an undercover Advocacy agent during a disagreement over Anvil thrusters. Kellar battled his way out of Spider to his personal spacecraft, where he then led criminals, Advocacy agents, and armed civilians in a series of battles through five systems. The Run ended in the Nexus system, when civilian Anna Flynn killed Kellar during a firefight.\n",
    "Kellog I": "Kellog I is a terrestrial planet in the Fair Chance Act (FCA) protected Kellog system. The closest world to its sun, Kellog I's surface is mottled with oceans of lava. Its atmosphere is partially composed of vaporized rock, which forms clouds that rain quartz onto its molten surface. A day on Kellog I lasts nearly three times as long as its year.\n",
    "Kellog III": "Kellog III is the third planet from the sun of the Fair Chance Act (FCA)-protected Kellog system. With a high-pressure atmosphere of carbon dioxide and a runaway greenhouse effect, temperatures on Kellog III are hotter than those on neighboring planet Xis (Kellog II). In 2911, a spacecraft containing three escapees from the prison QuarterDeck, located on Kellog VI, briefly hid in the planet's dense yellow clouds during a pursuit from law enforcement. The ship sustained corrosion damage to its hull over time, which eventually forced it to emerge and led to its capture.\n",
    "Kellog IV": "Kellog IV is a super-Earth in the Fair Chance Act (FCA)-protected Kellog system, and is the fourth planet from its sun. Early surveys of the planet indicated that it possesses copious mineral resources, but its location near Xis (Kellog II) has led the United Empire of Earth (UEE) government to deny petitions to begin mining operations there. In 2950, a proposal to start a pilot mining program on Kellog IV that would utilize inmates of the nearby prison QuarterDeck as a potential labor force was presented to the UEE Senate. Despite garnering strong support among members of the Universalist party, it did not gain enough votes for final approval.\n",
    "Kellog System": "The Kellog system is a protected planetary system that consists of a G-type main sequence star, five terrestrial planets, and one gas dwarf. Discovered in 2811 by navjumper Patek Coen, initial surveys revealed that Kellog II was home to a sapient species, and the system was placed under the protection of the Fair Chance Act (FCA). After two jump points to Vanduul territory were discovered in 2815, the United Empire of Earth (UEE) Senate approved a plan submitted by Senator Daniela Argen of Locke (Idris IV) to establish a prison and an antimatter processing facility on Kellog VI. Frequent visits from bounty hunters and haulers to the planet have made Kellog the most high-traffic system under the FCA.\n",
    "Kellog V": "Kellog V is the fifth planet from the sun of the Fair Chance Act (FCA) protected Kellog system. A gas dwarf, it has a rocky core and a thick, expansive hydrogen-helium atmosphere, but does not have enough mass to classify as a gas giant. Resources from the planet are sometimes harvested and used to supply the prison on neighboring planet Kellog VI, but only under close supervision from the United Empire of Earth (UEE) government.\n",
    "Kelos Costigan": "Kelos Costigan (2855 - present) was Imperator of the United Empire of Earth (UEE) from 2941 to 2950. He served as High-Secretary for two administrations and had a failed bid for Imperator in 2930 before being elected to office in 2940 as a member of the Universalist party. During his time in office, he was responsible for the passage of the Human-Xi'an Trade Initiative (HuXa) and the recognition of Aremis (Vega II). Prior to entering politics, he had a career in finance as a commodities trader.\n",
    "Kesseli": "Kesseli is the capital city on Lorona (Banshee III), United Empire of Earth (UEE). Dug deep enough into Lorona's surface that radiation suits aren't necessary, it is one of the largest underground cities in the UEE, and is where most of the miners who make the planet their home live. The city is still expanding as new tunnels are dug. Artificial lights on a day/night cycle, powered by a complex network of magnetic coils on Lorona's surface, are installed throughout the city. Bakers in Kesseli specialize in the beutrempe, a sweet or savory puff pastry that uses a local yeast strain to give it a unique and tangy taste.\n",
    "Khartu-Al (Kal\u2019tu\u0101l)": "The Khartu-Al (Kal\u2019tu\u0101l) is a Xi\u2019an light scout spacecraft adapted for Human use by Aopoa. Its base model, the Qhire Khartu (Kuail Kal\u2019tu), was originally developed for the Xi'an Empire as a scout and interceptor for the military. Aopoa extensively modified the control surfaces and components of the base model for the Human market. Owing to the fact that it was one of the first Xi'an-designed ships sold within the United Empire of Earth (UEE) it is often referred to as the \"Xi'an Scout.\"\n",
    "Kiami": "The kiami is a small, aerial animal indigenous to Crusader (Stanton II), United Empire of Earth (UEE). Found in all parts of the planet's atmosphere, the kiami feeds on aeroplankton and tiny pieces of organic matter floating on the wind. It forms an important part of the food chain as the main component of the stormwal's diet. Nearly half of all kiami are consumed by predators each year. Female kiami give birth to thousands of young at a time, and can breed again days after carrying a brood to term.\n",
    "Kiel Belt Alpha": "The Kiel belt alpha is an asteroid belt in the Kiel system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Located between Severus (Kiel III), and Kiel IV, it was used as a training ground by the UEE military during the Xi'an-Human Cold War (SEY 2530 - 2793). Many of its asteroids bear scars from being used as target practice.\n",
    "Kiel I": "Kiel I is a small planet that is tidally locked to the sun of the Kiel system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Extreme heat and stellar radiation have made the side facing the star dangerously hot and dry, while the far side of the planet is coated in nitrogen and methane ice. Due to the influence of the star's gravity, the planet is slightly deformed, with a bulge at its equator. The perpetual twilight of the solar terminator is a popular subject for artists and a hotspot for off-road driving enthusiasts.\n",
    "Kiel II": "Kiel II is a terrestrial planet in the Kiel system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). The second planet from the system's sun, it has a thin atmosphere of nitrogen and methane and is located outside the bounds green band, making it unsuitable for terraforming. Scans of Kiel II have revealed that the planet is rich in resources. However, the UEE has strictly prohibited any mining operations, and will pursue and detain those who attempt to mine illegally. Locals believe that the planet houses a secret underground military installation, though no evidence to support this claim has been found.\n",
    "Kiel IV": "Kiel IV is a planet in the Kiel system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). A gas dwarf, it has a rocky core and a thick atmosphere of hydrogen, helium, and methane. The high concentration of methane gives it a striking deep blue color. In 2939, Senator Janna Thurville of Severus (Kiel III) wore a gown inspired by Kiel IV's coloration to the Green Gala, created by designer Dyna Lei.\n",
    "Kiel System": "The Kiel system is a planetary system in the United Empire of Earth (UEE) with six planets, an asteroid belt, and an F-type main sequence star. Due to its jump point connection with the Perry Line system Horus, it was used as a military hub until the end of the Xi'an-Human Cold War (SEY 2530 - 2793). After tensions between the UEE and the Xi'an Empire cooled, the military largely withdrew and abandoned a great deal of infrastructure, especially on Severus (Kiel III). Governor Joona Tzur successfully offered these buildings to numerous aerospace companies in the early 2900s, and began an economic renaissance on Severus that earned the world Senatorial recognition in 2937. Kiel was voted one of the \"Top Ten Most Livable Systems\" by editors of New United in 2946.\n",
    "Kiel V": "Kiel V is a gas giant with prominent rings in the Kiel system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Known for its beauty, its hydrogen and helium atmosphere is banded with shades of white, orange, yellow, reddish-brown, and pale green. Starting in the early 2920s, it became a trend for local newly engaged couples to travel to Kiel V and be photographed with the planet and its expansive system of rings in the background.\n",
    "Kiel VI": "Kiel VI is a tiny protoplanet in the Kiel system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). During the formation of the system, it failed to accrete enough matter to become a planet but avoided getting subsumed into Kiel V. The farthest object from its sun, it completes its orbit roughly once every 122 SEY. A festival to celebrate its perihelion in 2956 is being planned on Severus (Kiel III).\n",
    "Kilgore and Poole": "Kilgore and Poole (K&P) is a Human manufacturer of personal armor systems. The company markets to high-end clientele who seek practical, stylish armor for everyday use instead of utilitarian military or industrial component armor made by most armor companies. K&P armor trades defensive power for increased flexibility, a design philosophy which has resulted in armor that allows for a wide range of movement.\n",
    "Kilian System": "The Kilian system is the largest planetary system in the United Empire of Earth (UEE). Discovered in 2463, it was a key stepping stone in Humanity\u2019s early push outward from the Sol system. Four of its fourteen planets are populated. Kilian became the main headquarters for the Human military in 2631. MacArthur (Kilian V) is the base of operations for the UEE Navy, while Corin (Kilian IX) is the home base of the UEE Marines. Keene (Kilian VII) is the system's only populated world with Senatorial representation.\n",
    "Kilian VIII": "Kilian VIII is a smog planet in the Kilian system, United Empire of Earth (UEE) that appears to be covered in a tropical ocean made of water. However, the liquid of the planet is a mix of hot, high-density, and volatile fluids. Due to the high-pressure atmosphere and the danger the ocean presents, it is extremely dangerous to attempt a landing on Kilian VIII.\n",
    "Kilian X": "Kilian X is a dwarf planet in the Kilian system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Tiny and frigid, nitrogen and methane ice coats the planet's surface, peppered with craters and cracks.

    "Koa e Ko'ia": "The Koa e Ko\u2019ia is a spacecraft race that combines marathon flights with physical endurance. Held every Xi'an year (MXY) in alternating locations around the Xi'an Empire, it was first competed in MXY III.690 (SEY 2341) in the Hyoton system. Before each race, the Koa e Ko\u2019ia governing body chooses checkpoints and destinations that are not revealed until the race begins. There is always a mixture of locations in space and in atmosphere. Once the race is underway, pilots receive the coordinates of their first checkpoint, and do not learn their second checkpoint until reaching the first, or their third checkpoint until they reach the second, and so on. Pilots must coordinate with their pit crews about when and where they will rest, repair, and refuel, and must choose strategic periods in which to lower their metabolism and extend their flying time without reaching a state of exhaustion. This continues until only one racer is left, which can vary anywhere between 200 and 50 standard earth hours. The pilot who has reached the most checkpoints is declared the winner. Other non-Xi\u2019an species were allowed to participate for the first time in SEY 2947.\n",
    "Odin IV": "Odin IV is a gas giant with a hydrogen and helium atmosphere in the Odin system, United Empire of Earth (UEE).

    "Oisha Suen": "Oisha Suen (SEY 2694 - 2793) was a pilot, mechanic, and smuggler most notable for her 2716 discovery of the Tohil system with her business partner Aadya Firmino. In 2713, she met Terra-born construction heiress Aadya Firmino at Levski in the Nyx system and the two started a smuggling operation using Firmino's Constellation Andromeda as their base. They were exiled by the People's Alliance in 2716 after Firmino attempted to steal one too many clients from other smugglers. While they made their escape, Suen detected a strange reading on a scanner she had just repaired. Further investigations revealed that she had discovered a new jump point into what would become the Tohil system. Firmino persuaded Suen into keeping the discovery to themselves until they could fully assess what they had found, but instead reported that she alone had located the new system and collected the reward money for herself. Suen, devastated by the betrayal, went to the Terra Gazette for a tell-all interview, which kicked off an investigation by the Department of Transportation and Navigation. The government eventually awarded credit for the system's discovery to both Suen and Firmino, and the Advocacy issued warrants for their past smuggling activities. Suen served a reduced sentence for her truthful testimony, and returned to Levski, where her banishment was rescinded and she started a passenger transport business.\n",
    "Olympus": "Olympus is a settlement on Ashana (Nul V). Built in the remains of the carrier UEES Olympus, which crashed into the planet in 2571 while pursuing a group of Human and Tevarin anti-Messer rebels, Olympus became a home to a diverse population of expatriates and outlaws from all known spacefaring civilizations save the Vanduul and Kr\u2019thak. An atmospheric system inside the wreck allows for its inhabitants to move through the settlement without the need for breathing equipment.\n",
    "Olympus Pool": "The Olympus Pool is a unique cosmic phenomenon located in the Goss system. It is an unusually dense interstellar cloud, packed with reflective, colorful cosmic dust in shades of turquoise, gold, and deep orange that is visible from the surface of all of the planets of the system. Visits to Goss specifically to view the Olympus Pool make a major contribution to the local tourism industry.\n",
    "Opera Mushroom": "The opera mushroom is an artificially engineered fungus developed by a team of researchers at the University of Rhetor\u2019s (UR) Department of Genetics. It has a fleshy, violet, trumpet-shaped, fuzz-covered stem that amplifies a natural sound created by the expansion and contraction of the hyphae as water passes through it. Because the mushroom is easily grown on spacecraft, it became popular as an on-board plant shortly after its commercial debut in 2925.\nIn 2918, genetics graduate students Mauveine Senae and Phil Ektos started a project to create an edible version of the fast-growing purple chimney mushroom, a toxic fungus indigenous to Reisse (Rhetor III). Dr. Yuki Hexa, Senae\u2019s advisor, joined the project after Senae and Ektos presented their early results: a mushroom with a deeper funnel shape and slightly less toxicity. As the team made further modifications to the mushroom\u2019s genetic code, the toxicity failed to fall to levels safe for Human consumption, but the divot in its stem deepened. One night, Ektos heard a strange tone in the lab, and traced it to the latest generation of mushrooms.\nThe team agreed to reframe their project to bring out the new audio qualities of the mushroom. By the end of 2920, they had developed a stable breeding population of mushrooms that produced varying tones depending on their size. Senae created a personal garden of the mushrooms in her dorm room, arranged so they resembled performers on a tiny stage. Hexa suggested the name \"opera mushroom\" after seeing this display. In early 2921, Ektos and Senae submitted their work on the opera mushroom to their dissertation committees and were awarded doctorates.\nAfter a four-week growing period, the constant motion of water through the mature mushroom causes ballistospores to slowly eject from the trumpet. After these spores fall onto a suitable substrate, they take root into a mycelium from which the mushrooms emerge. More and more mushrooms grow as the mycelium spreads underground, sometimes resulting in a widening ring-like pattern. Places where opera mushrooms grow can often be heard before they are seen.\nSamples of the opera mushroom were made available to plant nurseries on Reisse in 2925. Thanks to its novelty and fast growth cycles, the fungus was an instant hit. It became a popular houseplant, especially for long-haul spacefarers in need of something low-maintenance to decorate their holds. Skilled gardeners can grow mushrooms in arrangements that produce harmonizing tones.\nIn 2926, a wild, self-sustaining population of opera mushrooms was discovered 11 kilometers from the UR Genetics lab. The mushrooms continue to grow in the wild on Reisse today. It\u2019s a Day of the Vara tradition for some social organizations on the UR campus to tell ghost stories in nearby woodland with known opera mushroom populations to try to trick first year students into believing the woods are haunted\n",
    "Operation Mandrake": "Operation Mandrake, also known as the Battle of Oberon, was a 2946 United Empire of Earth (UEE) military offensive against the Vanduul. Led by Admiral Ernst Bishop of the 65th Battle Group, it took shape when the UEE Navy received credible intelligence that a large group of Vanduul was preparing to launch a mass invasion. Bishop dispatched a strike team to sweep the system and engage the Vanduul as soon as they appeared. While these forces engaged the Vanduul in battle, the UEES Retribution moved into position to block potential escape routes and then proceeded to destroy the remaining Vanduul fleet, leading to a conclusive UEE victory.\n",
    "Operation Unilateral Force": "Operation Unilateral Force was a 2940 military effort on the part of the United Empire of Earth (UEE). It was a combined attempt to incite infighting between Vanduul clans by disproportionately targeting a single clan. Experts anticipated that by noticeably weakening a single group of Vanduul, it might be possible to cause other clans to turn on the weakened group. The hope was that as the Vanduul battled each other, it would potentially reduce raids on Human colonies allowing the military to shore up further defenses. While the operation led to the crippling of a powerful Kingship, it did not generate the expected internecine conflict.\n",
    "Ophion, Inc.": "Ophion, Inc. was a geo-development and terraforming company that operated from 2501 to 2567. Founded by Eurynome Rhodes, it was initially known for its conscientious business practices and high rates of pay. However, after the founder's son Savion Guerra-Rhodes inherited the company in 2560, he began to implement cost-saving measures that resulted in shoddy products and low levels of employee satisfaction. Guerra-Rhodes utilized the resulting capital to purchase terraforming rights to Taranis II and its moon from the United Empire of Earth (UEE) government, where he planned to test the effectiveness of a new technology meant to utilize the orbital energy of Taranis 2a as a power source. Instead, the company caused a catastrophic accident that destroyed Taranis 2a, and the resulting financial and public fallout forced the company to close its doors in 2567.\n",
    "Orbital Platform": "An orbital platform is a space station, generally constructed for one purpose, that orbits a celestial body such as a planet, asteroid, or star. Orbital platforms have been used as bases for fuel refineries, terraforming operations, orbital bombardment, mining operations, border control, shipyards, and shipping centers, among many other things.\n",
    "Orbital Utility Craft (OUC)": "The Orbital Utility Craft (OUC) is a type of support spacecraft debuted by Argo Astronautics in 2578. A short-range loading spacecraft, it was built to transfer cargo pallets from orbital transports into ground-based rail networks for rapid deployment. Development of the OUC lead to the design of the Argo Multi-Purpose Utility Vehicle (MPUV). OUC are no longer operated and have since been replaced by the Argo MPUV and other specialized spacecraft.\n",
    "Oretani Belt Alpha": "The Oretani belt alpha is an asteroid belt in the lost Oretani system. When Turiya Terraforming surveyors discovered that many of the asteroids were rich in nitrogen, they established numerous agricultural stations to grow food for the thousands of workers living in space stations around Oretani II. When the only jump point collapsed in 2485, many were hopeful that these farms could help those stranded in the system survive.\n",
    "Oretani I": "Oretani I is a mesoplanet in the lost Oretani system. In a close orbit around its star, it has extreme temperature differences between night and day. Before the jump point collapsed, Turiya Terraforming had started construction on a temporary underground base to keep their surveyors safe from the harsh sun.\n",
    "Oretani II": "Oretani II is the second planet from the sun of the lost Oretani system. An ocean world with small land masses, it was located on the system's green band, and had been chosen as a prime candidate for future settlement. Turiya Terraforming took on the task of making the planet fit for Human habitation in 2483. Thousands of workers and their families took up residence in orbital stations on the condition that they would move to the planet once it was inhabitable. Early reports indicated that the results were positive, and that terraformation would likely be completed ahead of schedule. It is uncertain whether those left stranded there after the 2485 jump point collapse were ultimately able to relocate to the planet.\n",
    "Oretani III": "Oretani III is the third planet from the sun of the lost Oretani system. Located just beyond the green band, it was nevertheless identified as a potential candidate for terraformation after extensive surveys by Turiya Terraforming. Although the company never publicly shared their findings, experts speculated that they may have found valuable resources underneath the water ice glaciers that covered most of the planet's surface. However, the only jump point to the system collapsed in 2485, and Turiya's motivations remain unknown.\n",
    "Oretani IV": "Oretani IV is the fourth planet from the sun of the lost Oretani system. A gas dwarf, its thick, expansive atmosphere is composed of hydrogen and helium. At the time of the Oretani-Ferron jump point collapse in 2485, there was a single harvesting station in orbit around the planet. It is possible that those stranded in the system may have utilized resources extracted from Oretani IV to survive.\n",
    "Oretani System": "The Oretani system is a planetary system that consists of a K-type main sequence star, a mesoplanet, a terrestrial planet, an ice planet, a gas dwarf, a gas giant, a dwarf planet, and an asteroid belt. Discovered in 2481 via the Ferron system, it was immediately cleared for development by the United Nations of Earth (UNE). Turiya Terraforming dispatched a team of over two thousand workers and their families to prospecting stations in orbit around the ocean planet Oretani II in 2483 to kickstart the terraforming and colonization process. In 2485, the system's only known jump point suddenly collapsed. To date, no communications have since been received from the colonists and no additional jump points to the system have been discovered, leaving the fate of those initial colonists in question.\n",
    "Oretani V": "Oretani V is the fifth planet from the sun of the lost Oretani system. The largest planet in the system, it is also believed to be the oldest, and likely formed beyond the frost line over the course of three to four million years. Turiya Terraforming had outlined plans to build a network of harvesting stations in orbit around Oretani V, but at the time of the jump point collapse in 2485, construction had not yet begun.\n",
    "Oretani VI": "Oretani VI is the sixth planet from the sun of the lost Oretani system. Located on the very outskirts of the system, the planet has an orbit that takes thousands of days to complete. Oretani VI is largely dark red in color, caused by the presence of a hydrocarbon sludge on its surface formed from simple organic compounds long exposed to ultraviolet radiation. Methane ice is visible in the areas around impact craters.\n",
    "Origin Jumpworks": "Origin Jumpworks is a personal luxury spacecraft manufacturer based on Terra (Terra III), United Empire of Earth (UEE). The move to Terra is recent; until 2913, the company was located on Earth (Sol III), and had a policy only to use materials created in the Sol System to manufacture its 600 line of ships. Since the move, it has changed its outsourcing policy to accept components from across the UEE. The 300i and 890 Jump are among its bestselling designs.\n",
    "Orion": "The Orion is a mobile mining platform manufactured by Roberts Space Industries (RSI). It was designed as a solution for mining concerns that wish to conduct operations using a single ship. Built with an array of dedicated mining equipment, it includes extensive storage for resources, drone docks, and an on-board refinery. RSI advertises the ship as a \u201cone and done\u201d solution for large scale-mining that allows crews to locate, identify, and then extract minerals without needing additional support vessels. It is the largest civilian ship type currently sold by RSI.\n",
    "Orion Belt Alpha": "The Orion belt alpha is the only asteroid belt in the Orion system. It orbits the system's sun between Armitage (Orion III) and the gas giant Orion IV. In 2699, Humans discovered deposits of gold and platinum there and set up small mines. However, these were abandoned when Humans fled the system after the Battle of Orion in 2712. Vanduul have been observed harvesting resources from some of the belt's asteroids.\n",
    "Orion I": "Orion I is a protoplanet in the Vanduul-controlled Orion system. In 2709, the largest stellar flare yet recorded in the system erupted from its sun, melting the majority of Orion I's sun-facing surface. After the lava fully cooled, one side of the planet became a mixture of solidified lava, glass, and charred rock.\n",
    "Orion II": "Orion II is the second planet from the sun of the Orion system. A smog planet, it has a high-pressure atmosphere composed of carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid, giving the planet a yellow-brown appearance. There have so far been no recorded spacecraft landings on the planet's surface; however, scans have detected anomalies that may be structures. Scientific interest in Orion II was disrupted when the system was lost to the Vanduul in 2712.\n",
    "Orion IV": "Orion IV is a gas giant in the Orion system, nicknamed \"Abyss\" for its iconic deep black atmosphere. So little light reflects from Abyss that it is difficult to observe with the naked eye, save for a faint red glow that gives it the appearance of a lump of slightly glowing coal. Some tourists before the 2712 Vanduulinvasion visited the system solely to see Abyss in person.\n",
    "Orion System": "The Orion system is a planetary system in Vanduul territory, formerly of the United Empire of Earth (UEE). Armitage (Orion III) was once a recognized planet with Senatorial representation in the UEE. It was also the site of Humanity's violent first contact with the Vanduul in 2681. In 2712, the Vanduul launched a mass invasion that forced the UEE to cede the system.\n",
    "Orison": "Orison is a city based on a series of interconnected floating platforms located in the upper atmosphere of Crusader (Stanton II). Originally constructed by the United Empire of Earth (UEE)Navy to provide repair facilities for their capital ships, Crusader Industries looked at the existing infrastructure as an ideal location for their commercial shipbuilding operations. Over time, as the city drifts from its position, it must be occasionally moved into safe orbit by the synchronized firing of large thrusters built into each platform. Due to the gas giant Crusader's natural beauty and the presence of unique fauna such as the stormwal, Orison has become a popular tourist destination for visitors to the Stanton system. Cloudview Center serves as the main hub for habitation, tourism, and commerce. The Skyway Shuttle provides public transportation between platforms.\nIn the mid-2800s, the discovery of natural hydrogen and oxygen on the low-mass gas giant Stanton II made waves in the UEE. Colonization of a gas giant, long considered impossible, was now in reach. Initially, the planet was claimed by the UEE Navy, who constructed a series of platforms in 2855 designed to float in the upper reaches of the atmosphere in a region with gravity friendly to Human as a way to work on its capital ships in a breathable atmosphere. For a few years, a skeleton crew served on the platforms, conducting repairs as needed for the vessels that passed through the system.\nWhen the UEE made the decision to offer Stanton II up for sale in 2865, CEO of Crusader Industries Kelly Caplan purchased it. She considered the latticework of platforms the ideal place to save credits on the manufacture of their massive ships. After officially taking possession of the planet, CI converted the main capital ship repair drydock, Providence Platform, into a manufacturing center for commercial spacecraft. The company went on to save 40% on ship construction costs after only a year.\nCaplan's success earned her a position of trust with the board of directors, who were initially skeptical of her plan to buy Stanton II. Her next proposal, to use a portion of the company's new profits to develop the platforms beyond the shipyard complex, was approved the day the documentation was submitted. She named the settlement Orison after an old Human word for \"prayer,\" in reference to what she described as the \"meditative nature\" of Crusader.\nNamed after the founder of CI, the August Dunlow Spaceport is the city's main point of entry and is connected via Skyway Shuttle to the industrial district's Providence Platform and the commercial and residential district's Cloudview Center. The Cloudview platforms contain residences, shops, places to eat and drink, a Crusader Industries Showroom, Orison General Hospital, the Crusader Visitor's Center, and other amenities. Parks and other plant-filled areas built to invoke nature are scattered throughout each district. The iconic hosanna tree that decorates the walkways was created by CI to withstand high winds and low humidity, to self-pollinate, and beautify Orison with its pink flowers.\nOrison enjoys a steady stream of tourists to the Stanton system, drawn to Crusader for its scenic aspects and unique ecosystem. Visitors interested in the skies of Crusader can visit the Grande Observatory underneath the visitor's center, which provides views of Crusader's prismatic clouds. Storms deep in the atmosphere can be observed there, along with passing animals that live their lives in the air.\nOne such animal, the stormwal, is another of Orison's main attractions. A colossal creature that can grow up to 100 meters long, the stormwal is a planktivore that subsists on the thousands of tiny plankton-like animals that float in the currents of the wind. Enthusiasts can board a Discovery Tour to visit the nearby Stormwal Sanctuary and observe these majestic fauna in their natural habitat. Those more inclined to stay in Orison can visit the stormwal statute \"Until Then\" by artist Biphasha Zhu in the Cloudview Center.\n",
    "Orm": "The Orm are a developing civilization indigenous to the northern polar region of Xis (Kellog II) capable of creating tools, hunting, and building shelter. Xenoanthropologists estimate that it will be ten or more millennia before they are capable of space flight. Study of the Orm is restricted to observational research only under the Fair Chance Act.\n",
    "Osha (Kilian VI)": "Osha is a terraformed super-Earth located in the Kilian system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Many of the original settlers of Osha were service members' families and UEE Navy support personnel due to its proximity to MacArthur (Kilian V). While most of the people on Osha are connected to the military in some way, the planet has developed a strong music scene thanks to the varied cultural influences of its inhabitants.\n",
    "Osiris Belt Alpha": "The Osiris belt alpha is an asteroid belt in the Fair Chance Act (FCA)-protected Osiris system. One of the densest belts so far discovered, it experiences frequent collisions between asteroids, creating fields of debris that contribute to the already hazardous travel conditions. A catastrophic collision could endanger the developing life on Etos (Osiris I). The United Empire of Earth (UEE) military patrols the area to monitor for and divert or destroy any rogue asteroids that may become an issue.\n",
    "Osiris II": "Osiris II is the second planet from the sun of the Fair Chance Act (FCA)-protected Osiris system. Although access to the system is limited by the FCA, the United Empire of Earth (UEE) government has allowed the placement of multiple fuel refineries to help offset the cost of the long-term observation program aboard OB station Kobold. An outbreak of smuggling incidents starting in 2931 that utilized these platforms as launching points has resulted in increasingly negative press over their presence.\n",
    "Osiris System": "The Osiris system is a protected planetary system that consists of a K-type main sequence star, a terrestrial planet, a gas giant, and an asteroid belt. Discovered in 2788, it became the first system to be protected under the Fair Chance Act (FCA) when detailed surveys, delayed by the events of the anti-Messer Revolution, finally concluded in 2799 and revealed a complex biosphere beneath the cloud cover of Osiris I (later nicknamed Etos). OB station Kobold, tasked with observing and protecting the developing life on Etos, sits in one of the planet's Lagrange points.\n",
    "Oso I": "Oso I is a terrestrial planet on the Oso system, and is the first world from its sun. Tidally locked, one of its sides permanently faces its star, leaving the other side dark and cold. The warm side of Oso I is covered in a sea of lava that ends at the dividing line between night and day. Early surveys found that the reddish-black crust on the cool side was rich in iron. Before the Osoians were discovered on neighboring planet Oso II, Oasis Resort had given a press conference announcing speculative plans to create a luxury hotel with \"sweeping views of the awe-inspiring lava sea\" on a chain of islands near the solar terminus. They were forced to cancel their scheme when the Fair Chance Act was applied.\n",
    "Oso II": "Oso II is an inhabited terrestrial planet in the Oso system, best known as the home of the developing Osoian civilization. The second world from its sun, it sits in a temperate location in the green band and is covered in lushly forested continents and brackish liquid water oceans. While the atmosphere is naturally breathable, landing is prohibited in the interest of protecting the Osoians from outside interference and potential poachers. Its high-gravity environment has led to the evolution of many unique species that are a favorite research subject of xenobiologists stationed at off-world observation platforms.\n",
    "Oso III": "Oso III is a gas giant in the Oso system and is the third planet from its sun. Slightly green and white in color, its atmosphere is rich in silicate and iron clouds. Evidence suggests that it was once a rogue planet that was pulled into orbit around Oso's star at some point before the evolution of the Osoians on neighboring planet Oso II. Comets that pass through the Oso system are sometimes pulled into Oso III's atmosphere, where they are destroyed by high temperatures and violent weather conditions.\n",
    "Oso IV": "Oso IV is a terrestrial planet in the Oso system, and is the fourth planet from its sun. Lacking a core, it has an undifferentiated interior that is rich in a wide variety of minerals. Soldiers from the nearby United Empire of Earth UEE) Army observation base Chimera must keep Oso IV under guard to prevent rogue mining operations from forming there. In 2877, the Army made its largest arrest when they discovered an underground mine in the equatorial region that had been in use undetected for over 3 SEY.\n",
    "Oso System": "The Oso system is a Fair Chance Act-protected planetary system that consists of an F-type main sequence star, three terrestrial planets, one gas giant, one ice giant, and one dwarf planet. Discovered in 2861 by amateur explorer Errol Navis, who named it after his daughter, it seemed to be an excellent prospect for terraforming until a young civilization was detected on Oso II. Barred from their development plans, some surveying corporations leaked their planetary assessment findings to the press in an attempt to convince the public that it was the United Empire of Earth's duty to open the system. From these leaks, a popular movement formed in favor of uplifting the intelligent Osoians. Ultimately, the Senate chose to invoke the Fair Chance Act and set up a permanent military station to keep the system safe from potentially unscrupulous visitors.\n",
    "Oso V": "Oso V is an ice giant in the Oso system, and is the fifth planet from its star. With an atmosphere of ammonia vapor and other volatiles, it is nearly white in appearance, and has a complex, layered cloud structure. Thanks to its distance from Oso II, it supports a Covalex shipping hub and a handful of utility stations that help supply OB Station Chimera and any haulers that pass through the system with food and fuel.\n",
    "Oso VI": "Oso VI is a dwarf planet in the Oso system, and is the last planet from its star. Uniform in appearance, its surface is coated in tholin, a hydrocarbon sludge that colors the world dark red and covers up deep layers of methane and water ice. Like neighboring planet Oso V, it is orbited by several utility stations that serve haulers who pass through the system on their regular trading routes.\n",
    "Osoians": "The Osoians are a developing civilization indigenous to Oso II. They are in an early stage of development, having discovered tools and weapons, and created villages with free-standing dwellings. Language scientists are particularly interested in the Osoians thanks to their unique method of communicating: through flashes of color generated by the skin of their foreheads. They are protected by the United Empire of Earth (UEE) under the Fair Chance Act.\n",
    "Oya I": "Oya I is a terrestrial planet in the Oya system, United Empire of Earth (UEE), and is the first planet from its sun. Small and hot, its barren landscape is riddled with deep canyons that were formed by ancient lava flows. Although all of its volcanoes appear to be extinct, the planet is still geologically active and experiences quakes, with major events estimated to occur every few million years. Its youngest volcano is roughly 100 million years old.\n",
    "Oya II": "Oya II is the second planet from the sun of the Oya system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Although it lacks a metallic core, it has a magnetic field that is generated by large deposits of magnesium oxide deep in its mantle. During the 2580s (SEY), a group of Human anti-Messer separatists set up a small settlement on Oya II, choosing it over the naturally-inhabitable Oya III due to the presence of a small Xi'an colony there. They were able to remain undetected by the Xi'an colonists until MXY III.882 (SEY 2587), when the UEE Navy located the Oya-Castra jump point while trying to track down the separatists who had been conducting raids in the Castra system when they were low on supplies. Xi'an colonists who witnessed the UEE Navy ships attacking and killing their own people reported to the Xi'an government that there seemed to be elements within the UEE that rejected Messer leadership. Currently, the planet is home to several active mining operations.\n",
    "Oya III": "Oya III is a terrestrial planet in the Oya system, United Empire of Earth (UEE), and is the third world from its sun. With a temperate climate and naturally-occurring nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere, it was identified as a prime colony world by the Xi'an Empire (SaoXy'an) after its MXY III.866 (SEY 2566) discovery. A small settlement was established there that same year. However, the Xi'an government recalled the inhabitants in MXY III 882 (SEY 2587), when the UEE located the Oya-Castra jump point. At the end of the Xi'an-Human Cold War (SEY 2530 - 2793 / MXY III.838 - III.1044), the newly-reformed UEE government returned the former settlement to the Xi'an Empire as a gesture of goodwill. It is the only sovereign alien territory contained within the UEE.\n",
    "Oya IV": "Oya IV is a dwarf planet in the Oya system, United Empire of Earth (UEE), and is the fourth world from its sun. Reddish-pink in color, its surface is encased in thick methane-ethane that is coated with a thin layer of hydrocarbon sludge. In the 28th century SEY, there was a short-lived cosmetics trend that claimed the surface of Oya IV had \"age-reversing\" properties and utilized sludge harvest from the planet's surface in a wide variety of skin care products.\n",
    "Oya System": "The Oya system is a planetary system in the United Empire of Earth (UEE) that consists of a G-type main sequence star, three terrestrial planets, and one planetoid. In MXY III.866 (SEY 2566), it was discovered by test pilots for House Ng.at'ak during the preliminary flight of a cargo ship prototype. The Emperor ordered the construction of a colony on the third planet from the star, which had a naturally-occurring nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere and favorable climate conditions. However, after Lieutenant Eli Price of the UEE Navy located the Oya-Castra jump point in SEY 2587 (MXY III.882), the Xi'an government recalled the colonists and left their unfinished settlement abandoned. The UEE claimed the system and added it to the Perry Line, naming it Oya after an ancient Human deity of wind, storms, and death.\n",
    "Oza": "The oza is a commercial tree fruit grown in the United Empire of Earth (UEE). A hybrid of citrus trees that originated on Earth (Sol III), the oza was first grown on Angeli (Croshaw II) in 2812. Underneath its deep green rind is bright orange flesh with a tart, sweet, and bitter taste. Generally considered by Humans to be too fibrous to eat, the juice is prized for its complex taste and is popularly used as flavoring in sweet and savory applications, as well as in numerous cocktail recipes.\n",
    "P-52 Merlin": "The P-52 Merlin is an ultralight snub fighter spacecraft developed by Kruger Intergalactic. Roberts Space Industries commissioned the original design of the Merlin for use aboard models of the Constellation multi-crew spacecraft. Merlins require a mothership or static facility to operate, as they lack a quantum drive system.\n",
    "P-72 Archimedes": "The P-72 Archimedes is an ultralight luxury racing spacecraft developed by Kruger Intergalactic and spun off of the P-52 Merlin. Roberts Space Industries sponsored development of the design to pair with their Constellation Phoenix luxury spacecraft. While visually similar to the Merlin, the Archimedes features additional luxury styling and a special focus on performance realized through the use of lighter hull materials and an additional power plant intake.\n",
    "P5G Gladius": "The Gladius is a long-serving military light fighter spacecraft developed by Aegis Dynamics and first utilized by the United Empire of Earth Navy (UEEN) in the 26th century. Its frame is easily modified, and has undergone numerous technology retrofits in the past three centuries. Beginning in the 2930s, squadrons began to phase out the Gladius and convert to newer craft like the F8 Lightning, the F7A Hornet, and the Anvil Arrow, and surplus Gladius became available on the civilian market. In 2951, Aegis increased the budget on Gladius production and invested in upgrade packages and next-generation variants of the design.\nThe Gladius' development began in 2573 as a replacement for the obsolete Elio-Harman Stiletto interceptor, which suffered from an inability to adapt to more modern shield components and faced increased supply chain issues following Elio-Harman Aerospace's bankruptcy. The Gladius was created for service aboard smaller capital ships that weren't outfitted for full-scale aerospace operations. It was also the first ship to introduce a civilian-style modularity into fighter design; this allowed the Gladius to be quickly upgraded or outfitted for other missions without requiring a longer stay in the hangar for a refit.\nThe Gladius saw widespread adoption upon its rollout in 2579. Its base model has been continually upgraded over the years, to the point that a present day Gladius Mark VI pilot would have a difficult time flying a Mark I or Mark II model.\nThe Gladius has seen service in almost every type of operation and engagement involving the Human military for the past three centuries and recorded thousands of kills against pirates, armed rebels, raiders, and unidentified aggressors. Anti-piracy operations, reconnaissance, search and rescue missions, jump scouting (with extended duration packs installed) and countless other roles have been fulfilled by the Gladius.\nThe Gladius has proven effective against the Vanduul Blade, to which it is considered a rough 1:1 match. The design suffers against the latest Blade spacecraft encountered on the frontier, although exceptional Gladius pilots have made headway in developing techniques for countering the superior alien starfighters. A safer \"weave style\" maneuver has also been adapted for countering superior Vanduul forces.\nThe rollout of the F8 Lightning has changed the dynamic for the UEE fighter force, freeing up additional battle-tested Hornets to be handed down. The Navy has begun swapping second tier Gladius units over to Hornets as more elite squadrons go from the Hornet to the Lightning. This has not impacted every duty station as the Hornet is not a 1:1 replacement for the lighter Gladius. Nevertheless, the decommissioning process has created a major surplus of Gladius hulls and parts which have been made available to civilians with their weapons technologies and other classified components removed.\nGladius and their parts are still produced by Aegis, though not in the numbers seen at the height of the Messer Era (2546 - 2792). There is an upgrade team still at work which continues to develop functionality for the now widespread civilian adoption of the Gladius.\n",
    "Parker Terrell": "Parker Terrell (2888 - present) is a Human investigative journalist and host of the talk show Plain Truth. Until 2943, he worked as a reporter for New United, where he published multiple expos\u00e9s and built a reputation as a tenacious and opinionated columnist. Terrell vanished for three months after appearing on the debate program Showdown!, where he asserted that the United Empire of Earth (UEE) government had illegally used a super-weapon to destroy the surface of the planet Ellis XI. After he was found on Vann (Croshaw III) and questioned by Advocacy officials, he again appeared on Showdown! and insisted that he had been chased into hiding for speaking the truth. New United shortly terminated his contract. In the wake of this controversy, Terrell accepted a job offer from Spectrum to develop a talk show. Plain Truth debuted in 2944.\n",
    "Patek Coen": "Patek Coen (2786 - 2867) was a navjumper most notable for his discovery of the Kellog system in 2811. Born on Kampos (Ellis IV), Coen began his career as a pilot for a private ferry service from Kampos to neighboring planets Green (Ellis III) and Noble (Ellis V). He became interested in navjumping after reading a biography on Antoine Lebec, and took on private training courses in navigation and detection in his spare time. It was his goal to eventually live in a system he discovered himself. After nearly a decade of searching, Coen found a jump point to Kellog, but was disappointed when the existence of the Orm civilization on Kellog II came to light and the system was placed under the Fair Chance Act (FCA), meaning that he could not reside there. He retired from navjumping in 2839 when his autobiography A Refuted Dream became an unexpected bestseller.\n",
    "Paul LeSalle": "Paul LeSalle (2881 - present) is a Human businessman, former chairperson of the Centralist party (2942 - 2948), and former Senator of Cassel (Goss II) (2915 - 2939). As a Senator, he advocated for lower taxes and created an incentive system for businesses to move their operations to Cassel. LeSalle retired from the Senate in 2939, shortly after his former business partner Alin Hastings was convicted of multiple counts of embezzlement and tax evasion. After spending three years growing his hauling company and spending time with his family, he returned to politics as chair of the Centralist party in 2942. In April 2950, he succeeded in his bid to be elected as one of the five final candidates for Imperator of the United Empire of Earth (UEE). His campaign promised to include tax breaks for corporations and small business owners, reassessing the Fair Chance Act, creating programs to support bounty hunters and local militias, mandatory military service to receive certain civil benefits, and the implementation of the Safe & Secure Initiative: a program to replace jail time for minor criminal infractions with a system of fines and service.\n",
    "Penselin (Davien 2a)": "Penselin is the moon of Cestulus (Davien II), a planet in the United Empire of Earth (UEE). It was named for Dr. Daniel Penselin, a physicist who died there testing his improvements to the quantum drive. Its radius is only a few meters longer than that of Earth's moon.\n",
    "People's Alliance": "The People\u2019s Alliance is an independent Human political group that exists outside the governance of the United Empire of Earth (UEE) and seeks a social order based on egalitarianism and community. It formed during the reign of ImperatorCorsen Messer V (2609 - 2662), in response to his increasingly harsh policies on crime, which included broad expansion of the death penalty and suspension of the right to trial for political crimes. The group initially formed as they participated in community aid programs and staged peaceful protests of the new laws. However, as more and more of their members were arrested, imprisoned, and executed, their goals shifted from one of changing Human society to creating a society of their own. They founded a settlement in 2655, utilizing an abandoned mining outpost on the asteroid Delamar in the Nyx system. Named Levski after a historical revolutionary figure, the People\u2019s Alliance welcomed anyone fleeing the rule of the Messers, and the community grew. Today, the People\u2019s Alliance continues to accept new residents who wish to live away from under government rule.\n",
    "Perry Line": "The Perry Line was a military designation for a group of eight planetary systems that marked the borderlands between Xi\u2019an and Human-controlled space during the Xi\u2019an-Human Cold War (2530-2789). Named after Jianna Perry, the Navy general who introduced the strategy in 2542, the United Empire of Earth (UEE) designated the systems as no-fly zones and utilized them as military staging grounds. Each system was named after a god of war. After the signing of the Perry Line Pact, the systems were divided evenly between the Xi\u2019an and Human governments. While the UEE maintained the original names for its systems (Gurzil, Horus, Oya, and Tohil), the Xi\u2019an renamed the Hadur (Y\u0101\u2019mon), Indra (Kyuk\u2019ya), Pallas (Th.us\u2019\u016bng), and Virtus (La\u2019uo) systems.\n",
    "Persei (Rhetor II)": "Persei is the second planet from the sun of the Rhetor system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Soon after the system was discovered in 2287, surveyors identified vast deposits of rare elements in the crust. The United Nations of Earth (UNE) government used profits from selling the mining rights on Persei to fund the terraformation of Reisee (Rhetor III) and Mentor (Rhetor IV). Land not used for mining was set aside for the state-run University of Persei. Today, Persei is home to many research public and private research institutions, most notably the University of Persei Analytical Research and Quantification (UPARQ) center.\n",
    "Perseus": "The Perseus is a large gunship manufactured by Roberts Space Industries (RSI). First developed in 2528 for the United Planets of Earth Navy (UPEN), it was used in blockades and security patrols, most notably the Incident at Red Ridge in 2529. It became a mainstay along the former Perry Line after Xi'an-Human First Contact in 2530. In 2863, it was retired from production at RSI. In 2946, Admiral Ernst Bishop witnessed an aging Perseus participate in Operation Mandrake and requested that an updated Perseus-class fleet be put into production. After the creation of the Militia Mobilization Initiative, RSI expanded development to include a civilian version. The new Perseus, equipped with modernized weapons and a redesigned lower deck, was released in 2950.\n",
    "Personal Transport Vehicle (PTV)": "The Personal Transport Vehicle (PTV) is a small vehicle developed by Greycat Industrial. PTVs are intended for road travel and are capable of transporting two personnel and a small amount of cargo. Sometimes referred to as buggies or carts, they are commonly used in spacecraft hangars and on flight lines to deliver crews to spacecraft stored outside comfortable walking distance.\n",
    "Petram (Terra 1a)": "Petram is a captured carbonaceous asteroid, one of two natural satellites of Aero (Terra I), United Empire of Earth (UEE). It orbits closer to Aero than its sister moon, Petrus.\n",
    "Petrus (Terra 1b)": "Petrus is a natural satellite of Aero (Terra II), United Empire of Earth (UEE). Irregularly shaped, pockmarked with craters, and following an inclined orbit, Petrus may possibly be a remaining piece of a once larger celestial body.\n",
    "Phare's Ape": "The Phare's ape is a Human-like primate indigenous to Etos (Osiris I). A nocturnal animal, the ape spends its days sleeping in caves or under self-created dwellings, and its nights foraging for fruit, seeds, leaves, and other plant-based foods. Biologists believe that it has the potential to develop higher thinking thanks to its use of tools and practice of constructing shelter. It is largely due to the presence of Phare's ape that Etos is under the protection of the Fair Chance Act.\n",
    "Phiyi Tower": "The Phiyi Tower is a skyscraper located in the state of Acheron on Charon III. Designed by Alia De Monde, it was constructed to inspire hope in the people of Acheron after a deadly 2934 earthquake destroyed many historical and beloved buildings. Though it is now considered a masterwork of Supermodernist architecture, at the time, its construction was costly and complex. The project also endured numerous protests claiming mistreatment of laborers.\n",
    "Pi'tua (La'uo I)": "La'uo I is the first planet from the sun of the La'uo system, Xi'an Empire (SaoXy'an). A chthonic planet, it was the core of a hot Jupiter until the surface of the red giant it orbits expanded. Most of its atmosphere has evaporated, and what little remains continues to sublimate away in the heat. This has created a comet-like streak of gas and dust that trails the planet on its journey around its sun.\n",
    "Pico the Penguin": "Pico the Penguin is the official mascot of New Babbage, the largest city on microTech (Stanton IV). Debuted in 2902 by the microTech Tourism Board as part of that year\u2019s Snow Sport Invitational, the penguin was embraced by the inhabitants of the city and around the United Empire of Earth (UEE). Pico wears a helmet and a snow jacket and often carries a snowboard in honor of the popularity of outdoor activities in New Babbage. In recent years, it has become a trend on microTech for people to place Pico plushes in various locations around the world.\n",
    "Pike (Terra II)": "Pike is the second planet from the sun in the Terra system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). While its proximity to the sun and the thinness of its atmosphere make it a hostile environment, the rich reserves of resources on the planet have made it host to thousands of mining operations and refineries. While many outposts are built underground or in sealed arcologies to protect workers, processes are typically automated when possible in order to minimize Human exposure to the elements.\n",
    "Pinecone (Ellis XIII)": "Pinecone (Ellis XIII) is a protoplanet in the Ellis system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Nicknamed pinecone for its craggy surface, it's a major mining hub, rich in heavy metals and valuable minerals. Long-haul miners harvest resources from Pinecone, stop at Walleye for a refuel, and make the trek back to Earth (Sol III) to sell their cargo at a premium price.\n",
    "Pioneer": "The Pioneer is a colonization and factory spacecraft sold by Consolidated Outland, the second project pursued by the company. Introduced in 2947, the Pioneer was developed using funds from the successful Mustang series of single seat spacecraft and was intended to disrupt the then-standard process for locating, claiming and establishing homesteads on newly-explored worlds. The vessel is capable of deploying standardized claim buoys and constructing and deploying modular outposts using an onboard production line.\n",
    "Piracy (Space)": "Piracy (space) is an act of organized theft and criminal violence committed by spacecraft-based attackers. Acts of piracy can range from one-off attacks by one-person spacecraft to extremely organized, highly-planned operations that make use of dozens of pirates and multiple spacecraft. Piracy tends to flourish in unclaimed systems or away from frequently traveled transit lines. It usually focuses on the robbery of commercial transports' cargo and/or spacecraft.\n",
    "Planetary Surveying": "Planetary surveying is the profession of assessing and documenting the potential of a planet. Usually enacted upon initial discovery, surveyors map and catalog the planet's natural resources, and create recommendations that will determine the terraforming possibility of a planet, evaluate the planet's potential economic value, and identify prime settlement areas. Planetary surveyors use a mix of physics, engineering, astronomical and geological science, and applied technique to achieve their tasks. A surveyor must also be familiar with law in addition to their many other skills. Once a planet is surveyed, a surveyor usually continues in their work with the cooperation of a terraforming team or corporate and governmental concerns.\n",
    "Platform-Based Colonization": "Platform-based colonization is the use of platforms as bases for building colonies in environments which provide no other means of stable settlement. Platforms can be orbital, situated within a planet\u2019s atmosphere, built onto a planet\u2019s bedrock, or can float on bodies of water. Crusader (Stanton II) and Ergo (Nemo III) contain examples of this practice.\n",
    "Polaris": "The Polaris is a corvette-class capital ship developed by Roberts Space Industries (RSI) for the United Empire of Earth (UEE) Navy. Intended for combat situations, the Polaris was designed with a command center, repair and refuel facilities, and a bay capable of transporting one or more small fighters. It is used by the UEEN to conduct patrols and conduct search and rescue operations. Development of this ship was accelerated as a part of the Militia Mobilization Initiative (2946), after which a limited number of Polaris were made available for purchase on the civilian market.\n",
    "Port Conrad": "Port Conrad is a former city on Armitage (Orion III) in the Vanduul-controlled Orion system. Founded in the mid-2600s by the United Empire of Earth (UEE), Port Conrad was the fastest-growing settlement on Armitage. It was on the way to being selected as the new capital after Armitage's 2711 recognition from the UEE Senate. However, it was lost to the Vanduul in 2712. Today, burnt-out buildings, craters, and other ruins cover what was once a vibrant city. Some of the Humans who have chosen to live on Armitage in spite of the ever present threat of Vanduul violence use Port Conrad as a center of trade.\n",
    "Port Fairfax": "Port Fairfax is a United Empire of Earth Navy (UEEN) base located on Goss III, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Constructed during the Messer Era (2546 - 2792), it was originally intended to be a staging point for the invasion of the Terra system in case it tried to secede. After the events of the anti-Messer Revolution, the base was converted into a large military hospital complex.\n",
    "Port Olisar": "Port Olisar is a space station and trade hub owned and operated by Crusader Industries and located in orbit above the gas giant Crusader (Stanton II). It serves as a rest stop and gateway to the company\u2019s orbital shipyards, offering shops, accommodations for visitors, and parking areas for large spacecraft. Traders are known to stop at Port Olisar to buy and sell commodities.\n",
    "Port Renatus": "Port Renatus is the capital city of Mars (Sol IV), and is the first permanent Human settlement to be built on a planet outside Earth (Sol III). Once Mars' second attempted terraformation was successfully completed in the 22nd century, Port Renatus grew into a city-sized settlement as it became the de facto spaceport for all persons arriving to further develop the planet. The architecture of Port Renatus is studied by historians as an example of Humanity's first attempts to build modular cities.\n",
    "Port Tressler": "Port Tressler is a space station that serves as the main transfer hub to New Babbage on microTech (Stanton IV). Named after Aleena Tressler, a mentor of microTech\u2019s founder Magnus Tobin, it is owned and operated by microTech, and houses multiple shops and services focused on hospitality. Exports from microTech and other companies on the planet below pass through Port Tressler before they are loaded onto transports and distributed across the United Empire of Earth (UEE).\n",
    "Pressurized Research Station": "Research stations situated in hostile settings, such as non-terraformed planets, are built airtight, with artificially raised or lowered pressure to create environments friendly to researchers. These research stations can be used to study phenomena that would be otherwise inaccessible, such as smog atmospheres, flare stars, ice planets, and asteroids. Xi\u2019an research stations show a great deal of resilience in high-pressure atmospheres. Human researchers have yet to crack the secret behind this technology.\n",
    "Prime": "Prime is the capital city of Terra (Terra III) and is considered a cultural and economic center of the United Empire of Earth (UEE). Utilizing extensive urban planning, it has been designed to strike a harmonious balance between nature and city. Since the fall of the Messer government in 2792 there has been a vocal contingent of the populace vying to make Prime the new capital of the UEE.\n",
    "Prime Citizen": "Prime Citizen was the highest government office obtainable by a resident of the United Planets of Earth (UPE). Created in 2546, the office was proposed by Ivar Messer I, then High-General of the UPE, in response to a series of bombings reported as terrorist attacks on multiple populated planets. After the Advocacy failed to apprehend those responsible for the bombings, the Citizens of the UPE voted to dissolve the executive council known as the Tribunal and establish the office of Prime Citizen. On December 15th of that year, Messer was elected Prime Citizen in a landslide victory.\n",
    "Prime Transit Metrorail (PTM)": "The Prime Transit Metrorail (PTM) is a public transportation system located in Prime on Terra (Terra III), developed under government contract by Argo Astronautics in 2545. The PTM's main city center station sits in downtown Prime, with lines connecting it to hubs located in the city's main spaceport on Corsa and the historic Barrows neighborhood. Lined with greenways, waterways, and specially designed terraced gardens, it was designed to blend harmoniously into Prime's natural environment. Every year on the second week of May, the PTM celebrates the anniversary of its founding by planting a new tree along a randomly-selected route.\n",
    "Privately-Owned World": "Privately-owned world in the United Empire of Earth (UEE) is a recently created designation for a planetary body that is owned and governed by corporations or individuals. First created for the Stanton system, these planets are more akin to corporations than nations, eschewing democratic leadership and the requirements for senatorial representation. The majority of their inhabitants generally work for the corporate owner, with any additional population being made up of those who have set up independent businesses to supply food, clothing, non-corporate provided housing, and other necessities. Inhabitants are protected by the UEE's Common Laws, but the enforcement of said laws is up to the discretion of the corporation.\n",
    "Production System": "Production systems are planetary systems in the Xi'an Empire that have been specifically designated as work zones. Each planet in such a system has been terraformed from the ground up for a specific purpose, such as farming or manufacturing. They perform their functions under the supervision of the Xi\u2019an government, and are subject to Imperial law.\n",
    "Project Archangel": "Project Archangel is the official designation for a United Empire of Earth (UEE)-funded program to create an artificial planet. Commonly known as Synthworld, the project was announced in 2872 during Corbyn Salehi's tenure as Imperator as a way to move beyond the inherently destructive process of terraforming a planet. Popular at the time, it was considered the next step beyond the Fair Chance Act in protecting indigenous life while still allowing the UEE's expansion. The Chronos system was chosen for its Sol-like star and lack of planets in the green band. The project has since come under fire by the public for the amount of funds poured into it with little apparent progress towards its goal.\n",
    "Project Far Star": "Project Far Star was a United Empire of Earth (UEE) funding initiative initiated to expand its borders outward from the Virgil system. Terraforming companies and navjumpers who focused their exploration efforts in this direction were granted priority funding from the UEE for their efforts. This led to the discovery and colonization of the Terra, Tiber, and Orion systems, among others. The program ran from 2412 to 2681.\n",
    "Project Vespa": "Project Vespa was a United Empire of Earth (UEE) government project with the goal of developing a method to weaponize terraforming. Files were declassified and disclosed to the public in 2795 in the wake of the Messer Era War Crimes Trials (2793-2795). The project\u2019s leader and creator, Dr. Thessaly Tayac, led the terraforming, de-terraforming, and re-terraforming of Tayac I until his death in 2590. Project Vespa ended in 2750, when the planet became too unstable for the project to continue. Shortly thereafter, the project was discontinued.\n",
    "Prospector": "The Prospector is a mining spacecraft developed by Musashi Industrial & Starflight Concern (MISC). Spun off from the Freelancer project in 2925, the Prospector exchanges its sister ship's modularity in favor of a focus on small scale mining via its suite of boring and extraction tools. Able to mine and transfer ore collected on both planetary surfaces and in space, Prospectors are favored by independent operators for their flexibility.\n",
    "Prowler": "The Prowler is a Tevarin-designed combat personnel carrier built with air-shielded rapid deployment doors. Its name comes from the United Planets of Earth (UPE) designation for the original armored carrier initially observed during the First Tevarin War(2541-2546). The Prowler was utilized again in the Second Tevarin War(2603-2610), until the Tevarin were defeated by the United Empire of Earth (UEE). Prowlers that had not been lost in the war were destroyed during the Tevarin Purge. In the 2940s, Esperia obtained Tevarin spacecraft and other material from a cache of original Tevarin artifacts recovered in the Kabal System, leading the company to develop a modernized Human-manufactured recreation of the craft.\n",
    "Pue'nu (Kyuk'ya 1a)": "Pue'nu (Kyuk'ya 1a) is the moon of Kyuk'ya I, Xi'an Empire. During the Xi'an-Human Cold War (SEY 2530 - 2793), it was the site of a Xi'an military base that was used as a launch point for scouting missions into United Empire of Earth (UEE) territory. In 2798, a few years after the dissolution of the Perry Line, the Xi'an government converted the base into a hub to facilitate trade between the Xi'an Empire, the Banu Protectorate, and the UEE. The free contact between these civilizations has fostered the emergence of a Xi'an youth movement that rejects traditional values and embraces trends from other cultures.\n",
    "Pyen'pui.a": "Pyen'pui.a is a large Xi\u2019an shipping base and orbital scaffolding array located on the moon of Kyuk\u2019ya I. Ships moving through the system offload their cargo at the array, where it is then processed and distributed. Crews often spend time at the base on the surface while this is being done. Because of its position as a major trading center between the Xi\u2019an, Human, and Banu people, the base is unusually highly populated, and has become a hotspot for Xi\u2019an youth counterculture.\n",
    "Pyro I": "Pyro I is the first planet from the sun of the Pyro system. Its thick, high-pressure atmosphere hides a strange landscape beset by powerful winds and lightning strikes. Under the clouds, there is an ecosystem of plants and animals that endure its extremely high temperatures, even during powerful stellar flares. Surveyors and scientists constructed shielded research centers and mining outposts on Pyro I's surface starting in 2510, allowing a sparse population to attempt to utilize the planet before the facilities were abandoned by the close of the 26th century.\n",
    "Pyro IV": "Pyro IV is the outermost moon ofPyro V, and astronomers theorize that it was once the fourth planet from the sun of the Pyro system. At some point before Humans discovered Pyro, a massive celestial body collided with Pyro IV, catastrophically warping its landscape, destroying its atmosphere, and knocking it into the orbit of nearby gas giant Pyro V. Although the tectonic activity that resulted from this impact has quieted and a new atmosphere has formed, Pyro IV is far from stable. It is on a long, slow collision course with Pyro V, and will one day either crash into it or break up into a ring.\n",
    "Pyro System": "The Pyro system is an unclaimed planetary system that consists of a K-type flare star, five terrestrial planets, and a gas giant. Discovered in 2493 by Pyrotechnic Amalgamated, it was not claimed by the United Nations of Earth (UNE) due in part to the dangers surrounding its star. Instead, it was exploited by corporate interests until the 2560s, when the potential resources extracted from the system stopped outweighing the increased cost of maintaining equipment under a volatile sun. Pyro became a haven for outlaws by the early 2600s. Today, it is mostly populated by criminal factions that frequently struggle against one another for dominance. In 2947, extremist group XenoThreat seized control of Ruin Station, making them the de-facto leaders of the Pyro system.\nPyro, the system's star, is roughly 11.3 billion years old. It is classified as a flare star, or a variable star that undergoes dramatic increases in brightness within a few minutes, releasing powerful bursts of radiation. The closest planetary body to it is Pyro I, a terrestrial planet with a dense atmosphere and a silicate crust. Of the other terrestrial planets, Bloom (Pyro III) is the only one with naturally habitable conditions. Monox (Pyro II) has enough oxygen in its atmosphere to allow a person to breathe without protective equipment for only a short time before deadly health consequences set in. Those who visit the surface of Terminus (Pyro VI) can breathe there for long periods of time, but not comfortably. The gas giant Pyro V has six true moons. The planet Pyro IV, which was likely knocked out of its original orbit around the star by a massive celestial body, now circles Pyro V as its seventh and outermost \"moon.\"\nIn 2463, the watch officer of the Earth-flagged tanker ship Roustabout, Raj MacEwan, detected a strange signal in the Cano system. He conducted an analysis and compiled his findings into a detailed report, which he sent to the owners of the ship, Pyrotechnic Amalgamated. The board of directors chose to take no action at that time. In 2493, CEO Cecile Uchiha ordered that legacy flight records be reassessed to factor in advances in jump point detection technology. MacEwan's original report was found during this review, and the company dispatched an exploration ship to the region. After careful investigation, they discovered a jump point at MacEwan's coordinates, and entered it to find what would later be named the Pyro system on the other side.\nPyrotechnic Amalgamated celebrated the discovery until surveys revealed the existence of the flare star. Although scans of Pyro II had found valuable mineral deposits, the unpredictable bursts of radiation from the system's sun would make their extraction with the technology of the day a costly endeavor. The company made the decision to report the discovery to the UNE, planning to collect government subsidies that would fund their operations and guarantee future profits. Uchiha personally reported news of the discovery, and Pyrotechnic Amalgamated was granted first crack at the system when the UNE opened it for commercial activity.\nWhile the UNE gave corporate interests like Pyrotechnic Amalgamated the green light to enter Pyro, they held back on allowing full colonization. The flare star presented a completely unknown quantity, one that could have disastrous effects on Human life. Government officials elected to conduct a voluntary ten-year pilot program that would document the effects of the star's flares on Humans. If the conclusion of the study was favorable, they would sanction colonization and officially claim the system. However, the program became one of many that were cut short in 2499, when Project Far Star located the Magnus system and the Senate voted to channel all possible resources to the terraformation of Magnus II and the construction of a new center of shipbuilding for the UNE Navy. In 2516, when more funds might have become available, the discovery of the Terra system funneled any available capital towards the development of the naturally-habitable Terra III. 2523 brought the advent of the United Planets of Earth (UPE), and along with it, a complete reorganization of the government. The question of what to do with Pyro was put on indefinite hold, and the system remained unclaimed.\nOver the next few decades, commercial interest in Pyro waned as valuable minerals became thin on the ground and government subsidies dried up. After the end of the First Tevarin War (2541 - 2546), improvements in shielding technology allowed the few companies that remained in the system to extend their operations to previously unreachable areas, but this also increased the presence of outlaws as they too gained access to this tech. Eventually, bandit raids made turning a profit impossible. Some companies were forced to declare bankruptcy, including Pyrotechnic Amalgamated. By the end of the 2500s, almost all corporations had pulled out of Pyro, paving the way for outlaws to become the dominant force in the system.\nInstead of having formal, organized government, competing gangs rule over the Pyro system, creating a series of fiefdoms that are subject to change if the local dominant faction is ousted from power. Gangs that hold particular strategic points are seen as more powerful than others, especially those who control Ruin Station and the drug labs within it. Many gangs maintain strongholds on the surface of Terminus, the planet the station orbits, that they use as launching points for attacks.\nOutside of its criminal organizations, Pyro maintains a moderate population of mostly Human inhabitants whose main occupation is survival. Monox's mining infrastructure, long-abandoned by its former owners, houses squatters who will fiercely defend their right to live there in spite of its hostile environment. Those who live on the naturally habitable Bloom have an easier existence, but still struggle day to day. Joining a gang and attaining its protection is largely seen as a way of attaining a better life, and many choose this path if it's made available to them. Still, numerous others refuse the option, preferring the known risks of subsistence living over the constant dangers associated with gang membership.\n",
    "Pyro V": "Pyro V is the fourth planet from the sun of the Pyro system. It was given the classification of \"Pyro V\" when researchers came across strong evidence that its outermost moon once maintained a stable orbit around the system's star between Pyro III and Pyro V. When Pyro IV was struck by an unknown celestial body, it was knocked into Pyro V's gravitational sphere of influence. Residents of and travelers through the Pyro system are known to harvest hydrogen from Pyro V's green and yellow atmosphere.\n",
    "Pyrotechnic Amalgamated": "Pyrotechnic Amalgamated was a mining company most notable for discovering the Pyro system in 2493 and the Hadrian system in 2510. Founded in 2409 by Tromo Nivelin, it started out specializing in scouting and prospecting remote areas for viable claims and taking control before the arrival of potential competitors. It began extracting resources from the Pyro system in 2493, shortly after receiving the green light from the United Nations of Earth (UNE). The profits from this venture allowed the company to quickly expand its operations in Pyro, constructing countless bases and space stations throughout the system. In 2516, the company suffered a heavy financial blow when it overbid on what turned out to be a worthless mining claim on Terra (Terra III) that was later revealed to have been based on faulty data. It faced another massive loss in 2539, when the discovery of the Hadrian-Gurzil jump point caused it to lose access to its claims in the Hadrian system. Valuable resources in the Pyro system became harder to find in the 2540s, and the company truly began to struggle. Although the development of improved shielding technology in the 2550s allowed Pyrotechnic Amalgamated to expand into previously unreachable areas, the company was eventually forced to declare bankruptcy in 2563, when increased outlaw attacks and the cost of maintaining their equipment completely eclipsed their bottom line.\n",
    "Quantanium": "Quantanium is a deep red-orange mineral that occurs in igneous rock formations. A key ingredient in quantum fuel, quantanium becomes unstable when it is extracted, and is prone to breakage and degradation. Over time, it becomes more and more likely to combust, which sometimes results in explosions. Mining companies that extract quantanium must operate under strict safety regulations. Some independent miners have become injured or have died due to quantanium-related accidents.\n",
    "Quantum Drive": "A quantum drive is a type of engine that generates a Chan-Eisen field, enabling spacecraft to travel at approximately 20% of the speed of light. Because it takes a great deal of energy for a quantum drive to work, larger ships with more room for specialized power and cooling devices can remain in quantum travel longer than smaller ships. Quantum drives can be altered with a jump module to become a jump drive capable of traversing interspace.\nThe first Xi\u2019an quantum drive was created in 25343 BCE by House Yaing. Having recently developed terraforming, the Xi\u2019an used their new technology to expand beyond their home planet of RyiXy'an (Hyoton III), eventually colonizing Ka\u2019ua (Hyoton IV) and Tethle\u2019a (Hyoton II). The first Human quantum drive prototype was created by Dr. Scott Childress and his team in SEY 2075 and was capable of achieving 1/100th the speed of light. The debut of the quantum drive led to a sharp increase in exploration of the Sol system, conducted by institutions and private individuals. Historians are unsure exactly how long the Banu have had quantum engine technology due to their lack of historical data.\n",
    "QuarterDeck (Kellog VI)": "QuaterDeck (Kellog VI) is the sixth planet from the sun of the Fair Chance Act (FCA)-protected Kellog system. Named for the maximum security prison located on its surface, it is covered with ice and is inhospitable to Human life outside environmentally-controlled facilities. An antimatter processing plant located near the penitentiary is staffed by inmates of QuarterDeck, some of whom volunteer for the job in exchange for reduced sentences despite its dangerous and sometimes deadly conditions. In 2943, Senator Ghata Veras of Lo (Corel III) proposed that the prison and the plant be decommissioned due to its harsh conditions and track record of Human rights violations. The proposal was defeated by a narrow margin, leading many political commentators to speculate that it will be resurrected in the future.\n",
    "Quasi": "Quasi is the second largest city on Terra (Terra III), located in the southern hemisphere in the shadow of the Neesay Mountains. Most known for the large complex of ancient ruins discovered early in Terra's settlement, Quasi maintains a bustling tourist industry, and is home to the Quasi Institute for Xenological Studies (QIXS). Summers in Quasi are relatively cool, while winters are long and subject to more than 200 mm of snow per season.\n",
    "Quirinus Tech": "Quirinus Tech is a Human manufacturer of protective armor, known for using advanced flexible weaves and alloys to produce lighter pieces that match the stopping power of more traditional materials, albeit often at a higher cost. Because of their streamlined appearance, they are often used by private security firms who wish to maintain a lower profile. Roberts Space Industries (RSI) partnered with Quirinus to include their Calva helmet with the initial launch of the Mantis interdiction ship.\n",
    "Radegast Distillery": "Radegast Distillery is a historic producer of whiskey located in Port Renatus on Mars (Sol IV). Initially founded as a bar in 2520 by the Wilkes family, Radegast became a common stopover point once word spread about the house whiskey they produced in the back. Its popularity grew to the point where a full-size distillery was added in 2574.\nBoth bar and distillery were purchased from the Wilkes family by the Pan-Galactic Beverage Corporation (PGBC) in 2602. Radegast enjoyed 300 years of galactic success before falling out of the public eye in the early 29th century. In 2920, the brand underwent a resurgence when a private investor bought and rebuilt the original bar in the style of the 26th century. Today, Radegast is consistently ranked as one of the biggest sellers of Martian Whiskey in the UEE.\nDimitri and Danica Wilkes, eldest children of a second-generation Mars-born family, opened Radegast Bar in 2520. The bar saw early popularity among the Port Renatus locals, winning Most Welcoming Bar/Restaurant in a 2532 edition of Mars Today. Dimitri used the storage room (and his regulars) to experiment with home-brewing. He tried several unsuccessful beer recipes and made a notorious attempt at distilling gin, before finally trying his hand at whiskey. The recipe was an instant hit, catapulting the bar to even greater heights of popularity. Eventually, the Wilkes siblings retired on their profits and passed the bar down to their children.\nIn 2574, Danica\u2019s granddaughter added a permanent distillery to the family operation. Zara Wilkes\u2019 house whiskey, Radegast Gold, gained a wide-reaching reputation for smoothness and clarity of flavor. Radegast Distilleries opened a second facility on Angeli, Croshaw in 2585. The first untapped casks of Angeli whiskey were shipped to Port Renatus in 2598. The journey unexpectedly, but pleasantly, changed the Whiskey\u2019s flavour, prompting the launch of Radegast Homeward. This limited release was stored in Angeli oak barrels, but matured in zero-G, before returning to Mars for its final aging.\nThe company\u2019s success drove the Pan-Galactic Beverage Corporation (PGBC) to make an offer to buy the Radegast name, whiskey, and bar in the late 26th century. The Wilkes family wanted to make sure that the label stayed under their control, so a formal sale wasn\u2019t finalized until 2602. With the added benefit of PGBC\u2019s production and distribution network, Radegast whiskey began to appear in all corners of the UEE.\nThe last member of the Wilkes family left the Radegast brand in 2754, citing personal differences with the leadership of PGBC. This ended 180 years of Wilkes-led distillation of Radegast whiskey, as well as PGBC\u2019s access to the Wilkes-owned water source on Mars, Perepllut\u2019s Well. However, PGBC retained the rights to the Radegast name, and began selling a low-cost version of its Gold whiskey in 2766. Their first attempt at a new recipe, Radegast Neo, was appallingly received.\nIn the early 2800s, PGBC came under fire after they were accused of diluting Radegast Gold and passing it off as full strength. The company denied the accusations. However, the scandal repeated throughout the 2810s, finally reaching its climax in 2821 when evidence was published on Spectrum by independent investigator Willis Kemper. The Radegast brand was unable to maintain its reputation, and while the high-end limited editions were still considered top quality whiskeys, sales plummeted.\nPGBC dissolved in 2918, and with it, their right to the Radegast name. A private investor purchased the brand and the building where the original bar once operated. Two years later, the newly rebuilt Radegast bar reopened, rebuilt to look as it did in the 26th century.\nDescendants of the Wilkes family were hired to distill classic versions of their whiskey from the original recipes crafted by Dimitri and Zara. The new Radegast whiskeys soon grew in reputation, and the brand was reborn.

    "Red Festival": "Red Festival is a holiday celebrated in late January or early February annually in the United Empire of Earth (UEE). It originated in old Earth (Sol III) customs that celebrated the end of the year by tracking the lunisolar cycle instead of the solar cycle. Humans who followed the lunar calendar took their practice with them during the Human Colonial Expansion Era (2380-2530), often cementing the Red Festival as a tradition as early as the date of a colony's foundation. Today, the festival is celebrated by wearing colors that symbolize good fortune such as red and gold, eating long foods such as dyed red noodles or calossk tentacles, and the exchange of gilded red envelopes containing good luck tokens or credits. Recently, instead of handing the envelope directly to a recipient, givers will hide the envelopes for those deemed in need by fate to discover. Banu often join the festivities, hiding red envelopes in honor of Cassa, the Patron of Luck.\n",

Hangars developed by Revel & York are usually larger than others on the market, catering to owners of multi-crew ships and larger freighters.\n",
    "Revenant Tree": "The revenant tree is a variety of altrucia, a leafy tree indigenous to Terra (Terra III), United Empire of Earth (UEE). It emerged after the altrucia was introduced to Hyperion (Fora III) by geoengineers in an attempt to create shelterbelts against dust storms. While most of the trees didn\u2019t survive the environment, the ones that did adapted, giving rise to plants that seemed dead until closer observation. Its pollen is used to make the illegal drug altruciatoxin.\nIn contrast to the leafy, colorful altrucia, the revenant tree has coarse, spiny leaves and is dusty brown in color. Its thick, dense bark prevents collected moisture from evaporating in Hyperion\u2019s heat and high winds. Most of its nutrients come from the soil. Because its environment is covered by thick dust clouds for the majority of the year, it goes through long periods of dormancy followed by fast growth phases when exposed to sunlight and water.\nFollowing the brief wet season, the revenant enters its reproductive cycle, directing all of its stored energy towards producing flowers sturdy enough to withstand storm-force winds. The flowers open in the morning and evening. Wind currents pick up the pollen and distribute it to other plants. Once it has been fertilized, the revenant flower becomes a cone and produces seeds that too can be carried by the wind when they reach maturity.\nThe revenant thrives as a houseplant. Since it grows well under low-light, low-moisture conditions, it can be raised in places that receive little sunlight, such as sealed colonies or spacecraft. If it is over-fertilized and overwatered, its roots may rot or the bark may split and open the inside of the tree to potential infections. For these reasons, a revenant tree is best kept in an ecosphere set to mimic the conditions on Hyperion and prevent overzealous care. Inside the ecosphere, it will go through its full lifecycle. However, it will not successfully reproduce unless it is removed from the ecosphere and purposely exposed to another revenant. Well-tended revenant trees can live for a century or more.\nThe revenant is cultivated for its pollen which, though illegal under UEE law, can be chemically processed into a prohibited substance called altruciatoxin. Also known as dust, candy, or round off, altruciatoxin is powdered and can be absorbed through the mucus membranes. Those who wish to experience a reduced high may smoke it instead. It causes sensory enhancement, muscular relaxation, and lethargy in its users. Though uncommon, usage of the drug can induce a violent and rarely deadly allergic reaction, especially in those who are already sensitive to pollen.\nWild revenants can be used as a source of water. While the insides of the tree will induce vomiting if eaten raw, if passed through a fine-meshed sieve, the bitter liquid is safely drinkable by Humans and can hydrate in an emergency.\n",
    "Reza's Landing": "Reza's Landing is a city arcology built to withstand the harsh environment of Vosca (Elysium III). The structure was constructed by research company Rayari Inc. in order to protect their equipment from damage due to persistent sandstorms on the surface. The company would eventually allow non-affiliated residents to move in, and over the years several underground expansions have been built until it reached the size of a small city. Today, it is the primary center of commerce on the planet.\n",
    "SLAM": "SLAM, also known as redline, bounce, or berserker, is a stimulant that eases pain and inhibits the fear response in Humans. It is most commonly administered as a gas, inhaled from small vials of crushed crystals. Now illegal in the United Empire of Earth (UEE), it was initially introduced as a steroid and performance enhancer for athletes. Side effects of prolonged SLAM include involuntary tremors and muscle spasms.\n",
    "Sloma": "Sloma is a beverage often consumed by the Banu before they begin the negotiation process for new business deals, or during various social gatherings. Sloma is made up of a base liquid that is then altered by the addition of disparate ingredients brought to the table by everyone involved in the given social situation. After the concoction brews for a few moments, the resulting beverage is called sloma.\nSince they were initially encountered, Banu have usually opened negotiations, be they political, business-related, or otherwise, with the creation and consumption of sloma. The first Banu-Human Interstellar Peace and Trade Accord was hashed out over sloma created from ingredients contributed by General Neal Socolovich and a Protectorate Trade Essosouli, among others. Because Banu do not keep historical records, there is no definitive evidence that points to the origin of the practice. The Essosouli present at the first Peace and Trade Accord, when asked about sloma, simply replied that it was how things were done. Human and Xi\u2019an xenoanthropologists believe that the practice likely began before either civilization encountered the Banu.\nBefore negotiations begin, either a Banu who is hosting or a Banu who has previously agreed to host will provide the slomaddon, a usually ornately decorated vessel in which sloma is prepared. It will be partially filled with one of a variety of carrier liquids. Once the slomaddon has been opened, each participant of the deal or meeting will add something to it. Spice is one of the more popular additives, as it is light, easy to carry, and can significantly alter the sloma\u2019s flavor. However, anything that is safe to eat or drink is acceptable. This can create unique flavors. Banu can safely consume food that is dangerous for Humans, Xi\u2019an, and Tevarin, so it is a good idea to request that everyone bring ingredients that are respectful of their various dietary limitations. After the sloma has macerated for a few minutes, the host will provide cups, into which they will serve the resulting drink. Everyone is expected to partake.\nMethods by which Banu create and consume sloma can vary: some may serve it hot, some may serve it cold, some may ask you to bring a carrier liquid and vessel, some may insist upon drinking directly from the slomaddon, some may not use liquid at all and instead offer to share food. As with the original version, participants are still expected to add something to the dish. While food isn\u2019t technically sloma, it fulfills the same purpose.\nConsensus among Banu is that sloma is used to ensure all involved in a contract are entering into it without ill intent. Because everyone, from low-ranking assistants to the most powerful Essosouli, must drink the sloma from the same vessel, so no one can slip poison to anyone else. Especially careful Banu may insist upon randomly mixing cups, in case someone has laced one or more of them with poison instead of the sloma. Some Banu believe that the flavor of the sloma can positively or negatively portend how negotiations will go. Other Banu attach no importance to the flavor whatsoever.\n",
    "Something Every Tuesday": "Something Every Tuesday is a weekly entertainment talk show hosted by comedian Esen Landari. Each episode opens with a monologue that comments on current events, and then segues into interviews with a series of celebrity guests. Landari has used the program to invite little-known musical acts, comic performers, and authors to allow them to showcase their work. It first aired in 2934 in the Tuesday late-evening programming slot and was moved to an earlier time in 2935 after Landari's easy rapport with guests and a few surprise-hit sketches helped it earn high ratings.\n",

    "Spider": "Spider is a habitable space station in the unclaimed Cathcart system. The station was fabricated by squatters from a half-finished platform and hundreds of abandoned spacecraft hulls that were dumped in the system. Despite its reputation for lawlessness, the station's location among a dense nest of garbage protects it from a large military or police force. Over the centuries, several major outlaw groups have utilized it as their base of operations. It is also home to an extensive black market. The name originates from the station's unusual shape; the various attached spacecraft resemble the web of a spider.\n",
    "Spirit Wars": "The Spirit Wars were an interconnected series of massed conflicts between the Xi\u2019an Empire and the Kr\u2019thak, spanning multiple centuries (II.961 - II.1735; SEY 351 - 1342 ). These wars had a profound effect on Xi\u2019an society; during a Kr\u2019thak incursion in II.1706 (SEY 1305), Emperor Iith se Xy.\u014d and all in her House were exterminated. The Second Imperial age came to an abrupt end and a century of anarchy rose in its place.\n",

Squadron 214 was activated in 2675, and has served in multiple conflicts, but it is best known for its role in the Siege of Tiber and a dangerous bombing run into the Virgil system in 2932. Because of this, the squadron is most commonly associated with Anvil Aerospace Gladiators, but has been composed of multiple types of spacecraft including Hornet fighters and Gladius interceptors over the years.\n",
    "Squadron 88 (The Lost Squad)": "The 88th Logistic Support Squadron (Squadron 88, \u201cthe Lost Squad\u201d) is an inactive United Empire of Earth Navy (UEEN) unit. Founded in 2608, the squadron served as a logistics and operations support squadron to various units, bases, and capital ships until its final posting to the Caliban system in 2792. The 88th became publicly revered due to their defense of the Caliban system against a massed Vanduul invasion for two days without reinforcements, allowing millions of civilians to escape (Fall of Caliban, 2884). A single unnamed pilot survived the prolonged assault. All others were killed in action. In honor of their sacrifice, the UEE Navy officially retired the 88th in 2885. Their motto was \u201cStand and Deliver.\u201d\n",
    "SSN/CAtv": "SSN/CAtv is a Human Spectrum network that provides news, political analysis, commentary programs, news magazines, and talk shows. It was founded in 2458 as a result of a merger between former news channels Sheridan Special News Television (SSNtv) and Communications Alliance (CA). It was the first news network to broadcast to all United Empire of Earth (UEE) star systems. While it currently has hundreds of affiliates and satellite offices, it primarily broadcasts out of Terra (Terra III).\nSSNtv was the first network originating from Earth (Sol III) to broadcast to Mars (Sol IV) and was the dominant news network among Humans until the discovery of the Croshaw system in 2271. As Human territory expanded to other planetary systems, SSNtv's reach narrowed due to limitations in communication technology. Content delivery delays of several days to several weeks were common between systems. Rival network CA was established on Reisse (Rhetor III) in 2398 to combat this gap. Thanks to the Rhetor system's cutting-edge communications network, CA\u2019s reach expanded more quickly than SSNtv's, and the network began to struggle. In 2458, SSNtv accepted a merger proposal from CA and SSN/CAtv was born.\nSSN/CAtv initially transmitted a continuous stream of news, hosted by a rotating cast of anchors. It gradually increased its focus on politics, purchasing Showdown! in 2522 as its keystone debate program. This shift in content brought high profits with it, enabling the network to open a new headquarters on Cestulus (Davien II) in 2525. In 2529, SSN/CAtv provided on-the-ground coverage of the Unified Currency Riot in Jata, Cestulus, including its quelling by the United Planets of Earth (UPE) military. After first contact with the Xi'an in 2530 and discovery of the Tevarin in 2541, the network\u2019s content began to gradually lean pro-war and anti-alien.\nUpon the ascension of Ivar Messer I to the office of Prime Citizen in 2546, SSN/CAtv\u2019s content took a hard pro-government shift. The host and crew of Showdown! were fired and replaced after they aired a special episode urging people to act against Messer's consolidation of power. Deacon Messer II became one of the network's prime shareholders in 2601. After this point, SSN/CAtv became one of the cornerstones of the United Empire of Earth's (UEE) propaganda machine.\nIn 2630, SSN/CAtv relocated to an expansive headquarters on Terra. The network slowly began to allow some UEE-critical content to air, while still maintaining a pro-Messer stance in the majority of its programming. For example, SSN/CAtv played a pivotal role in discrediting Terran Senator Assan Kieren's reputation during his call for Terran sovereignty in 2638, but it also allowed its pundit and debate programs to feature anti-military and pro-secession guests.\nDuring the power struggle between Astrid Messer VII and Samuel Messer VIII, reporters on multiple shows stepped too far out of line, harshly criticizing the Messers for their infighting. In 2699, Astrid Messer VII retaliated by conducting mass arrests and censoring over half the network\u2019s programming into cancellation. Samuel Messer VIII rescinded the mass censorship upon taking office in 2701, but ordered that all content aired henceforth on the network had to be approved by the Imperator's office. Those imprisoned by Astrid Messer VII were not pardoned, and were forced to serve out the remainder of their sentences.\nAnonymous SSN/CAtv insiders began organizing with anti-Messer activists as early as 2702. They aided the resistance in two key ways: they allowed the rebels to pass along encrypted messages via the network's communications arrays, and fed them information uncensored by the Messer government. Once such piece of information was footage from the Massacre of Garron II. On 11 April 2972, technicians responsible for the network feed allowed footage of the Massacre, along with a message from the resistance group Tide, to interrupt a broadcast of SSN/CAtv Nightly News. This broadcast was the inciting incident of the revolution that would eventually depose the Messer regime.\nSSN/CAtv hosts a wide variety of news and news-related content. Some of their flagship programs include pure news shows Empire Report and SSN/CAtv Nightly News, the pundit-centered debate program Showdown! and the UEE-critical talk show Plain Truth. It has satellite offices on most recognized planets in the UEE.\n",
    "SSN/CAtv Nightly News": "SSN/CAtv Nightly News is a Spectrum news show that airs after its sister show Empire Report. It covers more local news stories that are not aired on Empire Report, but are still deemed newsworthy by SSN/CAtv.\n",
    "Stalford": "Stalford is a mid-sized city located on Rytif (Bremen II). Positioned just north of the planet's equator, Stalford is home to numerous water farms and commercial vivariums. Stalford is also the headquarters of spacecraft designer and manufacturer Consolidated Outlands. In SEY 2792 during the late Messer Era (2546 - 2792), anti-Messer activists used Rytif as a hub of operations to organize the overthrow of Linton Messer XI. In recent years, the city has become a tourist site, owing to a variety of monuments commemorating Rytif's role in the fall of the Messer regime.\n",
    "Stalker": "The Stalker is a variant of the Avenger patrol ship developed by Aegis Dynamics. When the standard Avenger fighter failed to connect with military users, Aegis adapted it as a police spacecraft with the addition of the Stalker Prisoner Transport Module, a system of cell and restraints that allowed safe prisoner transport. These changes also attracted bounty hunters to purchase the ship, in need of methods by which to bring in their targets alive. Although the Stalker was the first variant of the Avenger developed, its popularity eclipsed that of its parent model, leading many to incorrectly assume it was the original Avenger type.\n",
    "Standard Recovery Vehicle (SRV)": "The SRV (Standard Recovery Vehicle) is a tug spacecraft designed by Argo Astronautics. Like Argo's MPUV, the SRV was designed as a dockyard support spacecraft capable of manually towing freight and cargo and conducting search-and-rescue missions. The SRV\u2019s tractor system can tow smaller spacecraft or can be combined with other SRVs for larger tasks. Operated by most major human freight companies as well as the United Empire of Earth Navy (UEEN), SRVs are a common sight around major ports.\n",
    "Stanton System": "The Stanton system is a planetary system in the United Empire of Earth (UEE), discovered in 2851 by navjumper Toshi Aaron. It is one of only two fully colonized systems in the UEE, and is made up of three super-Earths, a gas giant, an asteroid belt, and a G-type star. All planets in the system were sold by the UEE government to four major corporations soon after their discovery. While inhabitants are protected under UEE\u2019s common laws, they are also subject to rules imposed by the individual corporations that own each planet.\n",
    "Star Marine": "Star Marine is a series of sim-games developed by InterDimension Software as ultra-realistic tactical shooters focusing on battles between United Empire of Earth Marines and various outlaw forces. Development of the first Star Marine started in 2941 with the formation of the InterDimenision; it was released in 2945 to positive reviews and has become a popular competitive game. Multiple games in the series have been used as simulators for actual combat training by the UEE military. The games are also the basis for the popular action vids Star Marine and Star Marine 2: BloodLock.\n",

Gemini serve in support roles in the UEEN supply chain and are utilized as front line refuelers. Aegis has made the Gemini available to civilian buyers in limited numbers.\n",
    "Starliner": "A starliner is a type of commercial spacecraft used primarily for the transportation of passengers. A significant portion of total interstellar travel within the United Empire of Earth (UEE) is done aboard these vessels. The Genesis starliner, manufactured by Crusader Industries and assembled in the upper atmosphere of Crusader (Stanton II), is one of the most common models of this type of ship. Major transportation companies such as Meridian Transit primarily operate starliners.\n",
    "StarWatch": "StarWatch is a popular celebrity gossip and pop culture talk show produced for Spectrum that debuted in 2940. Fans of the show refer to themselves as StarWatchers. Most episodes of the program open with a segment in which the host comments on pieces of celebrity gossip accompanied by images and video, some of which is reported by StarWatchers. Guests often appear to discuss various pop culture topics or to be interviewed. The current host of StarWatch is Carolyn Choy, known as Callie C.\n",
    "State (United Empire of Earth)": "A state is a non-sovereign political organization within the United Empire of Earth (UEE), usually referring to centralized governing bodies within unified territories. States on Human colony worlds are typically formed around settlements or other developed areas. States maintain a variety of local types of governments which manage their local affairs within their place in planetary governments and the UEE as a whole. On worlds with UEE senatorial representation, states are managed by a Governor and a hundred Representatives.\n",
    "Stella Fortuna": "Stella Fortuna is a Human cultural celebration associated with good fortune and success in new ventures. It was first established as a commemoration of the successful colonization of Mars (Sol IV). Feasting, fireworks, festivals, and other forms of mass celebration are hallmarks of the holiday, along with the colors gold and green. It is celebrated each year on March 15th throughout the United Empire of Earth (UEE).\nIn the mid-22nd century, the people of Earth (Sol III) established Humanity\u2019s first successful extraplanetary colony on Mars. This was the second attempt at colonization; the first Human colony on Mars failed late in the terraforming process when an error in the atmosphere processors led to sudden mass atmospheric collapse. 4,876 Humans died. The second attempt at a colony was largely regarded as doomed. In a widely-circulated article on the potential dangers a Mars immigrant might face, Kelsey Forset of Sentinel NewsOrg simply wrote, \u201cDon\u2019t tempt fate.\u201d This message was ultimately co-opted: \u201cTempt Fate\u201d with \u201cDon\u2019t\u201d crossed out became an unofficial slogan of the early Mars colonists.\nIn 2200, multiple Earth-based governments announced plans for an interplanetary holiday to celebrate 45 successful years of Human habitation on Mars. It would be held during the following Earth-Mars conjunction (18th March 2202) to emphasize the connection between the planets. Martian schoolchildren were invited to submit possible names for the new holiday. \u201cStella Fortuna\u201d was selected from an entry provided by Estelle Priya, age 11, of Port Renatus Public School 17.\nLarge public carnivals sponsored by space travel and terraforming companies were held on Mars and Earth. They featured rides, food, games, and half-price tickets to attractions throughout the Sol System, from space stations on the asteroid belt to the volcanoes of Io. New parcels of land on Mars were raffled off to festival attendees, along with a ship outfitted with a quantum engine provided by Roberts Space Industries. Local businesses sold souvenirs stamped with the slogan \u201cWe Tempted Fate: Stella Fortuna 2202.\u201d The day ended with a green and gold firework display.\nStella Fortuna was held at varying times of the year during Earth-Mars conjunctions for over a half century. In 2257, the majority of governments on Earth and Mars declared March 15th the official holiday. While March 18th was initially proposed, it was not selected due to conflict with another holiday - the anniversary of the first Human born on a planet other than Earth.\nStella Fortuna has evolved from a holiday commemorating the early Mars colony to one that celebrates good fortune, boldness, tempting fate, and embarking on new business ventures. This was caused by a number of factors, but the against-all-odds success of the Mars colony combined with the long-term success of early settlers were two major influences. In particular, the families who won land during the first Stella Fortuna did a great deal to promote the idea that the holiday was associated with good luck. By the time the holiday\u2019s final date was selected, people preparing for interplanetary trips were already asking the stars for their blessing. It became a tradition in the late 2200s for explorers to toast the stars before embarking on searches for jump points, or for people launching new business ventures to begin them on March 15th.\nThe largest celebrations still occur on Mars. Most businesses close for the holiday and the day after. The festival officially kicks off with a parade featuring elaborately decorated floats in the form of spaceships or stars. Celebrants clad in colorful, light-up costumes throw candy, raffle tickets, or other small prizes from atop the floats into the crowd. Carnivals filled with rides and games run throughout the day and night. Intoxicated crowds will spontaneously burst into traditional songs such as \u201cAim for the Stars but Strike from Mars\u201d and \u201cIlluminate the Way.\u201d Marriage proposals are as common as new business ventures; the green and gold firework display that concludes the festival is a favorite time to seal the deal on business and romantic partnerships alike.\n",
    "Stiletto": "The Stiletto was a medium interceptor sold by the now-defunct company Elio-Harman Aerospace in the early 26th century. It was one of the first spacecraft designs commissioned by the United Empire of Earth (UEE) and was used specifically to intercept enemy bombers. The Stiletto was withdrawn from service in 2580 in favor of the Aegis Dynamics Gladius following issues with its supply chain and the design's inability to adapt to rapid advances in shield technology.\n",
    "Stor*All": "Stor\u2022All is a Human shipping container manufacturing company that sells such well-known products as the Big Box series found on many ships.

Their vacuum-proof containers are built to transport a wide range of materials via different spacecraft designs.\n",
    "Storm Rider Palm": "The storm rider palm is a tree created by Rayari Inc as a part of its line of plants meant to aid in the planet terraformation process. Tall and robust, its flexible trunk and lacy leaves allow it to endure very strong winds. Rayari Inc is currently developing a variant of the storm rider palm meant to withstand the HyperClay-infused dust storms on Hyperion (Fora III).\n",
    "Stormwal": "The stormwal is a warm-blooded vertebrate indigenous to Crusader (Stanton II), United Empire of Earth (UEE). It was discovered in 2855, when three workers assembling Providence Platform for the UEE Navy were startled by a stormwal rising from the depths of the planet's atmosphere, causing them to drop some of their tools. The stormwal is the largest known animal with the ability to fly.\nSome stormwals can reach 100 meters in length upon reaching adulthood. They are most commonly rosy-gray in color, with iridescent red fins and lightly-striped hides flecked with gold. Deep blue stormwals with blue-gray fins have also been observed. They have long, spade-shaped snouts and four eyes, two on each side of the head. Four long barbels trail off the head from the chin and the brow, which are used alongside the filaments on their pectoral, dorsal, and tail fins to sense the miniscule electrical fields of aeroplankton and kiami, their main prey. Four other elongated non-frilled fins are situated on the left and right side of the stormwal's belly. Six nostrils on either side of the snout and two enormous cavities just behind the head take in air that is internally distilled by specialized organs to contain only helium and hydrogen, which is then used to fill inner flight bladders that enable the stormwal to maintain flight. Excess air is expelled, and new air is taken in as needed.\nAdult stormwals must eat between 1000 and 1500 kg of aeroplankton, kiami, small floaters, and other animals each day. They cooperate with their pods when hunting, flying in circles to force prey to concentrate in the center of an air vortex. The stormwals then take turns swimming into the trapped prey, taking huge gulps of air until they are sated. Solo stormwals often eat by diving into cloud formations that are densely-populated with aeroplankton.\nElectricity is vital to a stormwal\u2019s life cycle. To communicate, either to signal that a food source has been found, seek mates, call young who have flown too far from their parents, or simply to engage in bonding behavior, stormwals send electro-magnetic pulses to one another over long distances. When engaging in courtship, each stormwal will weave an intricate electro-magnetic pattern and transmit it to their prospective mate. This process can take several days. If either animal dislikes the pattern, they will break away from one another and seek mates elsewhere.\nStormwal reproduction is a coordinated affair. Because they give live birth and stormwals do not land, a stormwal in labor must be watched by one or more other stormwals. When the squall emerges from its mother, one of the watching stormwals will catch it and let it rest, so that it has time to slowly fill its internal air cavities. Squalls that are not caught are in great danger of falling to their deaths. When the squall is finally able to float, it is returned to its mother, where it latches onto her mammary gland and feeds. It will nurse as its primary food source for up to two SEY.\nDenizens of Orison consider the stormwal a symbol of their city. A large statue of a stormwal entitled \"Until Then\" by artist Biphasha Zhu sits in Cloudview Center, and the official mascot of the city, Finley the stormwal, can be purchased in plush form in local shops. Visitors to Orison can book tours to the nearby Stormwal Sanctuary, where they try to catch a glimpse of the animals in their natural habitat.\nIn recent years, poachers have been spotted hunting and killing stormwals within the bounds of the Sanctuary, to the outrage of locals. Crusader Security has increased its presence in the area as a deterrent to further attacks.\n",
    "Suj Kossi": "Suj Kossi (b.2900) is a Senator for Jalan (Elysium III), United Empire of Earth (UEE). Kossi began his political career after his honorable discharge from the UEE Navy, where he received a Medal of Valor for his service during a dangerous repair mission under fire from the Vanduul. After a race against Gabrielle Graci\u00e1n and Sakae Marigold, he became the first Tevarin to be elected to the office of Senator in 2946. He was re-elected in 2951.\nKossi was the second youngest child of six children, born in 2900 to Sei Kossi and Qy Rusfa in the hills outside Gemma, Jalan. His parents and extended family, who shared Kossi's home, were career criminals who primarily targeted and robbed homes, outposts, or other potentially profitable locations. From the time he was ten, he joined his family on low-risk raids, eventually taking on more dangerous tasks after he turned fifteen. In 2919, a raid on a water farm outside Nedila erupted in violence, and Kossi's eldest sister Fef Rusfa was killed in the firefight, alongside all three of the farmers who had tried to defend their home. In the aftermath, Kossi and his surviving family members learned that all of the farm's equipment was broken, and there was nothing worth stealing. Overcome with a feeling that his sister had died for nothing and he'd wasted his life, Kossi ran away from his family and enlisted in the UEE Army.\nFor six years, Kossi served with distinction, reaching the rank of Sergeant in 2925. He was selected soon after for a transfer to the Navy for flight training. As a pilot, he ran sensor repair missions until 2928, when a surprise Vanduul raid interrupted what should have been a routine mission in the Oberon system. Kossi used his ship to shield three technicians under his command from ongoing enemy fire, saving their lives at the cost of sustaining grievous injuries. He spent the next sixteen months in an intensive care unit. Though he recovered, long-term effects from his injuries ended his military career. Kossi was awarded Citizenship, the Medal of Valor, and an honorable discharge for his service.\nKossi moved to an apartment owned by Ustiel Housing Development, a small corporation that owned and managed a handful of low to middle-income habitations around Gemma. After his neighbors suffered a series of unjust evictions after weeks of intimidation tactics from their building manager, he conducted some research and noticed that this pattern occurred across all properties owned by Ustiel stretching back 15 years. Kossi responded by organizing a class-action lawsuit that eventually resulted in a criminal inquiry.\nIn 2933, Kossi ran for a position on the Gemma city council, which he lost. Undeterred, he ran again in 2937 and was elected based on a platform of ensuring housing equality. He began to appear on local news programs as an advocate for renters and a de facto spokesperson for Tevarin, a role which earned him some criticism from the Tevarin community. After successfully enacting a rent-control ordinance in 2944 during his second term, Kossi announced his intention to run as Senator on the Universalist ticket. In 2946, he temporarily suspended his campaign for a week following the Battle for Vega II to report for duty with the Naval Reserves. Analysts believe that this action pushed his poll numbers high enough to ensure his successful election at the end of the year.\nSince taking office, Kossi co-authored several important pieces of legislation, sat on the Subcommittee on the Interior, led outreach programs to raise the Tevarin vote, and became a regular guest on popular spectrum news programs. He is a strong supporter of loosening current Citizenship requirements and expanding enfranchisement across the UEE. After Laylani Addison became Imperator in 2950, he worked with her to draft legislation that would create programs to incentivize Tevarin involvement in the public sector. He was re-elected in 2951. Koto Dodson of the Terra Gazette has speculated that Kossi will run for Imperator in 2960, a rumor that the Universalist party has neither confirmed nor denied.\n",
    "Supermodernist Architecture": "Supermodernist architecture is an architectural school of style that blends the use of developments in high technology with a sense of hopeful meaning. The style rose in popularity in the early years of the 30th century. The Phiyi Tower, constructed in the wake of the 2934 earthquake in Acheron on Charon III, is a masterwork of the style.\n",
    "Sydney Kamarck": "Sydney Kamarck (2761-2864) was a historian of Human Political Systems at the University of Rhetor, most well-known for her 2812 book The Path to Prime Citizen. In 2806, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission released thousands of personal and official records connected to the Messer family to the public. Researching these documents, Kamarck discovered that Ivar Messer I may have orchestrated the series of bombings that claimed thousands of Human lives in 2546. In her book, she alleged that while Messer\u2019s former squadmates Adam Corr and Cyrus Ishitaka most likely perpetrated the attacks, they did so under Messer\u2019s orders.\n",
    "Sylvie Randall": "Commander Sylvie Randall (2835-2884) was a United Empire of Earth Naval Officer, most famously known as the final commanding officer of the 88th Logistic Support Squadron (\u201cthe Lost Squad\u201d). She took command of the 88th in 2878, and spent her tenure requesting more funding and supplies from the UEE Navy and spending what assets she could gather on the repair of Caliban\u2019s early warning system. Her last act as commander was to order the 88th to defend and evacuate the civilian population of the Caliban system. She died alongside her squadron during the Fall of Caliban in 2884.\n",
    "Synergy": "Synergy is a Human brand of wellness-themed energy drinks manufactured by conglomerate Sakura Sun. The beverage was first developed in 2865 by a team of researchers led by Dr. Taka Jeong. Originally, it was marketed purely as an energy drink, with commercials featuring deep-space explorers and long-haul spacers using the beverage to stay awake and alert while navigating dangerous territory. After modest success, Sakura Sun switched Synergy to natural ingredients and re-branded it as a healthy alternative to other energy drinks. Varieties include Synergy+, which delivers stimulants over an extended period of time, and the electrolyte drink SynergySport.\n",
    "Syntek": "Syntek is a synthetic material created by Origin Jumpworks. It is designed to emulate the look, feel, and strength of titanium while increasing durability and reducing the weight. Origin uses Syntek in the construction of their X1 Velocity spacecraft.\n",
    "Synthworld (Chronos III)": "Synthworld (Chronos III) is an incomplete artificial planet located in the green band of the Chronos system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). In 2872, Imperator Corbyn Salehi announced a new scientific endeavor to construct a planet in the Chronos system as a way to move beyond the inherently destructive process of terraforming, made unpopular at the time thanks to the Massacre of Garron II. The project was designated Project Archangel, and construction began immediately. The proposed Synthworld would ultimately have a radius of about 7500 kilometers, and is projected to have an Earth-like gravity upon its completion. However, its continued setbacks, no visible end date, and the many financial scandals that have stemmed from it have made Synthworld a point of contention among Humans.\n",
    "Tadmor Terraforming Concern": "Tadmor Terraforming Concern (TTC) was a terraforming company that operated from 2298 to 2369. Founded by tech entrepreneur Korian Tadmor and backed by venture capitalist funding, the company won terraforming rights to Fora II in 2308. Although the planet was located outside the green band, they hoped that recent advances in technology would allow for the resource-rich world to be terraformed. However, after many years of fruitless attempts, TTC's financial backers brought a lawsuit against the company in 2364 for failing to deliver on its promises. TTC sold all its Fora-based terraforming platforms to the new company NemoCo in order to fund its legal battle. When NemoCo announced it had discovered a jump point to a new system in Fora with help from former Tadmor employee Dae-ho Ochoa, TTC filed suit against them, alleging that Ochoa discovered the system while employed with TTC and thus TTC was entitled to a stake in NemoCo's operations. Due to a lack of evidence, the suit was dismissed in 2369, and TTC was subsequently dissolved.\n",
    "Taernin, the Great Traveler": "Taernin, the Great Traveler, is the Banu god of travelers, crossroads, and navigation and is one of the most common deities in the Banu pantheon. Due to the Banu practice of not recording historical events, its origins are shrouded in mystery. When it is depicted, Taernin closely resembles a Banu, and is often portrayed standing in a boat and holding an oar. Soulis that depend upon travel for trade often commission prayers to Taernin from Religious Soulis to keep them safe from unforeseen obstacles. Xenoanthropologists believe that Taernin worship may have originated on the Banu homeworld.\n",
    "Talon": "The Talon is a light fighter manufactured by Esperia. A replica of the historic Tevarin fighter designated \"Talon\" by the United Planets of Earth (UPE) military during the First Tevarin War (2541 - 2546), the spacecraft features maneuverable phalanx-style shields that can be moved to protect vital points. In 2941, three partial hulls of Talons were discovered on Kabal III, alongside a cache of other Tevarin artifacts that survived the Purge that took place at the end of the Second Tevarin War (2603 - 2610). Esperia used these recovered hulls to create modern replicas, which they debuted at the Intergalactic Aerospace Expo in 2950.\n",
    "Talon Shrike": "The Talon Shrike is a variant of the Talon light fighter manufactured by Esperia, and is a replica of the historic Tevarin fighter designated \"Shrike\" by the United Planets of Earth (UPE) military that was first observed in use during the latter years of the First Tevarin War (2541 - 2546). The Shrike has a modified, missile-focused configuration compared to the base Talon, and is armed with internal missile racks to increase damage inflicted during hit-and-run attacks. Esperia consulted Tevarin and Human historians to ensure that the modern reproduction of the Shrike was as authentic as possible.\n",
    "Talon Weapons Systems": "Talon Weapons System is a Human weapons and munitions manufacturer based in the Croshaw system. Founded in the early 27th century by Taisei Jessop, it produces weapons designed to be mounted aboard civilian spacecraft. These were first produced in order to provide protection against guerrilla Tevarin during the Second Tevarin War (2603-2610). After the war ended, the company was hit by multiple legal challenges regarding their production of civilian weaponry. The company\u2019s victory in the courts set precedent for how civilian spacecraft are armed. Today, Talon produces a variety of missiles, torpedoes, ordnance racks, and grenades.\n",
    "Tamsa I": "Tamsa I is a chthonian planet that orbits the black hole at the center of the Tamsa system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Once a gas giant, it lost its atmosphere via hydrodynamic escape due to proximity to its former star, leaving its dense metallic core intact. Astrophysicists speculate that when its original star went supernova, it was ejected from orbit and became a rogue planet until it was eventually captured by the gravitational pull of Tamsa's black hole.\n",
    "Tamsa II": "Tamsa II is a gas giant in the Tamsa system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Unlike the former rogue planet Tamsa I, it naturally formed in the wide accretion disk that orbits the black hole at the center of the system. The internal heat of Tamsa II is very low, with an upper atmospheric temperature of around 200 degrees Celsius. However, the deepest sections of its mantle are just hot enough to decompose methane into elemental carbon. Once formed, the carbon then floats upwards and combines with other carbon atoms to become diamonds. These diamonds rain down into the mantle, where they are broken into carbon again, and the cycle repeats.\n",
    "Tamsa System": "The Tamsa system is a planetary system in the United Empire of Earth (UEE). Uniquely among UEE systems, its two planets revolve around a black hole rather than a star. The innermost world is thought to have been a rogue planet before it was captured by the black hole, while the outermost planet likely formed in the black hole's accretion disk. The system was discovered in 2943 by Banu explorer Kofi Baf\u00e9uma, who sold the rights to the system to the UEE under the condition that they be allowed to name it after noted Human visual artist Tamsa Wheel. Currently, Tamsa is accessible only via the Banshee-Tamsa jump point, but UEE officials hope that other jump points will be found in the near future.\n",
    "Tamsa Wheel": "Tamsa Wheel (2883-present) is a noted Human visual artist known for creating interpretive large-scale sculptures from unexpected mixed media types. As described by art critic Herin Chiber, her work portrays the \"...delicate balance between mathematical precision and the universe's unbridled chaos.\" Banu explorer Kofi Baf\u00e9uma named a planetary system, Tamsa, after Wheel in 2943 because of their passion for her artwork.\n",
    "Tanga Belt Alpha": "The Tanga belt alpha is an asteroid belt in the unclaimed Tanga system. Astronomers hypothesize that its asteroids are the remains of one or more terrestrial planets that broke apart when the star expanded into a red giant. Since then, the star has collapsed into a white dwarf, leaving a vast empty gap between the belt and its sun. Many of the asteroids, long-exposed to the heat of the white dwarf, have been sublimated into ovoid shapes.\n",
    "Tanga I": "Tanga I is a chthonian planet in the unclaimed Tanga system. Dense and metallic, it was once the core of a gas giant and has high gravity in spite of its relatively small size. When its sun expanded into its red giant phase, its newly close proximity to the star's surface stripped away the world's hydrogen and helium atmosphere via hydrodynamic escape. Any ice that once surrounded the core evaporated away, leaving only metal and silicates behind it.\n",
    "Tanga II": "Tanga II is an ice planet in the unclaimed Tanga system, and has a surface coated with thick sheets of water, ammonia, and methane ice. When it first formed, Tanga II orbited beyond the frost line, which shifted when its star entered its red giant phase. After the red giant collapsed into a white dwarf, its temperature spiked and Tanga II began to sublimate. A trail of expelled vapor follows Tanga II as it traverses around its sun.\n",
    "Tanga System": "Tanga is an unclaimed planetary system that shares jump points with the United Empire of Earth (UEE). It consists of a young white dwarf star, two planets, and an asteroid belt. Astronomers speculate that before the star entered its red giant phase, one or more planets could have existed in the system between the asteroid belt and Tanga I. When the star expanded in diameter, it likely destroyed any celestial bodies that orbited it too closely. At the end of its red giant phase, the star collapsed into a white dwarf and expelled the picturesque planetary nebula that surrounds the system.\n",
    "Tangaroa (Helios II)": "Tangaroa (Helios II) is a terrestrial planet located in the Helios system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Highly geologically active, volcanic eruptions are frequent and unpredictable, often giving rise to short-lived landmasses that are reclaimed by the sea. Its few permanent islands are located mostly at the planet's poles. Due to a combination of tidal forces and lower gravity, enormous waves hundreds of meters high are frequent on the planet. The capital city Mariana is located partially on land and partially under the sea, and is home to a thriving culture of extreme water sport enthusiasts.\n",
    "Tanys": "Tanys is a city located in the Corsti Mountains on Locke (Idris IV), United Empire of Earth (UEE). Founded as a resort town for climbing enthusiasts, in 2542 Tanys became the center of the resistance movement against the invading Tevarin called the Greys. When Idris IV was officially recognized by the UEE Senate in 2546, the Governors Council chose to name the planet after Rachel Locke, leader of the movement. The natural beauty of the surrounding landscape and the city's importance to UEE history have given rise to a thriving tourism industry.\n",
    "Taranis 2a": "Tarnis 2a is the moon of Taranis II, the second planet from the sun of the unclaimed Taranis system. During the Messer Era (2546 - 2792), the geo-development company Ophion, Inc. used Taranis 2a and its parent planet as testbeds for various new terraforming technologies, including a dubiously-designed platform that was meant to utilize the moon's orbital energy as a power source. A combination of errors in math from the overworked and underpaid engineers, mistakes in construction from the exhausted workers, overall poor design, and the use of shoddy parts led to a catastrophic energy discharge from the largest platform that ruptured the mantle of Taranis 2a, eventually causing the moon to break apart. The \"Broken Moon of Taranis\" map featured in the popular space flight simulator Arena Commander was inspired by Taranis 2a.\n",
    "Taranis Belt Alpha": "The Taranis belt alpha is the first of the unclaimed Taranis system's asteroid belts. Densely packed with asteroids, frequent collisions occur that eject dust, rocks, and other material into the already crowded area. As a consequence, travel there can be treacherous, and there has been little large-scale commercial activity. Some smaller operations have attempted to turn a profit via mining and other means, but the belt has otherwise been left largely untouched.\n",
    "Taranis Belt Beta": "The Taranis belt beta is the second asteroid belt in the unclaimed Taranis system. Like its sibling belt, it is dense with asteroids and dangerous to traverse. Nevertheless, some individuals use it as a place to hide from pursuers. Smugglers, pirates, and other outlaws have been known to operate there, making civilian travel in the belt a risky prospect at best.\n",
    "Taranis I": "Taranis I is a mesoplanet in the unclaimed Taranis system. The closest planet to its sun, temperatures on Taranis I are sometimes high enough to warp hulls. In 2559, the planet came to fame when a new review of survey data captured in the wake of the system's discovery revealed what appeared to be a Human face carved into its northern surface. Nicknamed the \"Face of Taranis,\" this anomaly created a brief cultural craze that eventually led to a privately-funded investigatory expedition. Reports confirmed that the so-called face was actually a mountain range that had been photographed in an unusual position. Public interest dissipated shortly after.\n",
    "Taranis II": "Taranis II is the second planet from the sun of the unclaimed Taranis system. Although Taranis II was classified as a poor choice for terraforming after its discovery, geo-developer Ophion Inc. attempted to terraform the planet in 2566 using an experimental process. The company's history of utilizing underpaid and underqualified labor along with substandard parts to cut costs led to numerous accidents, the worst of which scarred the planet's landscape and cracked its moon in half. Matter from the resulting debris field has been striking Taranis II ever since. Much of the terraforming machinery Ophion abandoned has fallen to the planet's surface, where it continues to burn.\n",
    "Taranis III": "Taranis III is the third planet from the sun of the unclaimed Taranis system. A smog planet, it has a thick and high-pressure atmosphere that gives rise to frequent storms. Although the air isn't breathable, it is home to a sizable settlement of Humans and Tevarin situated in an abandoned research station called Bethor. Established in 2536, it was originally created as a base of operations for a privately-funded research team interested in weather control techniques. Expats from the United Empire of Earth (UEE) claimed the abandoned station in 2551, and have since expanded it.\n",
    "Taranis IV": "Taranis IV is the fourth planet from the sun of the unclaimed Taranis system. Its hydrogen and helium atmosphere is pale yellow, banded with cream and tan. As the system's main stop for harvesting fuel, it sees occasional traffic from independent travelers. However, its thick ring of captured asteroids discourages stops from larger commercial ships.\n",
    "Taranis System": "The Taranis system is an unclaimed planetary system that consists of an A-type main sequence star, a mesoplanet, two terrestrial planets, a gas giant, and two asteroid belts. Discovered in 2478 by the United Nations of Earth (UNE) survey ship Mythic Horizon, the initial scouting report classified its planets as high-risk candidates for terraforming and the system was left largely untouched. During the Messer Era (2546 - 2792), Taranis was sometimes used as a testbed for new technology, which led to a 2566 accident that destroyed the moon of Taranis II. In addition to the dangerous debris field created by this incident, the system's two dense asteroid belts pose a persistent navigational hazard for travelers.\n",
    "Tarquin Klast": "Tarquin Klast (2879-present) is the elected Governor of the state of Dellin on the planet Charon III. Born to a low-income family, he was elected governor amidst the ongoing conflict Between Dellin and its neighboring state of Acheron. Klast has been accused by newsorgs and watchdog groups of removing the checks and balances of his own government, arguably to maintain power. He has responded to these accusations that these changes have been necessary to safeguard Dellin from hostile Acheron military action.\n",
    "Tatavo": "Tatavo is a high-end design firm that specializes in bespoke furniture, especially for spacecraft. Located on Cassel (Goss II), it was founded by carpenter Eva Tarvel and metalworker Samvel Vanlian, after the long-time friends renovated the interior of Vanlian's ship. Members of Vanlian's family, impressed with what the pair had done, requested custom work of their own. As word of mouth spread, they took on more and more renovations as independent contractors until officially founding Tatavo in 2901. Origin Jumpworks partnered with Tatavo to design the furniture used in the luxury spacecraft 600i, released in 2947.\n",
    "Tayac Belt Alpha": "The Tayac Belt Alpha is a circumstellar asteroid belt in the Tayac system located between Tayac II and Tayac III. It is best known as the home of the Xi\u2019an-Human-Banu art installation Silent Song, an enormous art piece completed in 2900 and created over the course of a decade to celebrate the Ark\u2019s centennial anniversary.\n",
    "Tayac I": "Tayac I is a small, terrestrial planet without an atmosphere in the Tayac system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). From 2546 to 2750, the planet was terraformed and de-terraformed multiple times by the leadership of Project Vespa, a Messer-backed initiative to develop a planet-destabilizing super weapon. The damage done to the planet during that time has rendered it unable to be terraformed.\n",
    "Tayac II": "Tayac II is a gas giant in the Tayac system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Its planetary rings are among the largest and densest in the known universe. Visitors to Tayac often take special trips to see the rings up close during their time in the system. Postcards featuring the dark rings against Tayac II's bright atmosphere are commonly sold in rest stops and gift shops in the system.\n",
    "Tayac System": "The Tayac system is a small planetary system in the United Empire of Earth (UEE), made up of a G-type main sequence star, a terrestrial planet, a gas giant, a dwarf planet, and an asteroid belt. Starting in 2546, Dr. Thessaly Tayac, for whom the system is named, conducted a long-term research project on Tayac I to explore the possibility of weaponizing the terraformation process and technology. Thanks to his experiments and those of his successors, the surface of Tayac I has become too unstable to support permanent terraforming. Tayac is best known as the home of the Ark, a neutral library and archive built for the use of all civilizations.\n",
    "Tears of Fire": "Tears of Fire is a painting by the early Messer Era landscape and military artist Aaron Fring. It was completed in 2610, after Fring witnessed Tevarin Warlord Corath\u2019Thal and his fleet falling through the atmosphere of Jalan (Elysium IV, formerly Kaleeth) in an act of self-immolation.\nTears of Fire is Fring\u2019s only work to have been inducted into the UEE Historical Vault for Antiquity. It hangs in the Bentley National Gallery on Jalan.\nThe Tevarin lost their homeworld, then called Kaleeth, to the United Planets of Earth (UPE) a the end of the First Tevarin War (2541-2546) On 09 March 2603, a faction of Tevarin led by Warlord Corath\u2019thal sparked the Second Tevarin War; a protracted and brutal guerrilla war for the Elysium system against the United Empire of Earth (UEE). On 24 June 2610, after a catastrophic defeat in the Centauri System at the hands of Squadron 42, it became clear to Corath\u2019thal and his forces that they could not defeat the UEE military and an armed populace. Faced with the choice between surrender and death at the hands of his enemy, Corath\u2019Ttal chose a third option: he ordered his surviving loyal forces to charge through the UEE military blockade for Elysium.\nOn 25 June 2610, the remains of the Tevarin fleet reached Jalan\u2019s atmosphere. The residents of the planet braced for an attack. Instead, Corath\u2019thal and his fleet dropped their thermal shields and dove for the planet. As they burned in the atmosphere, Corath\u2019thal\u2019s final words were picked up by human communication devices: \u201cWe die at home, and we die free.\u201d\nAaron Fring was born on Ferron on 13 October 2578 to teacher Max Fring and pilot Mary Fring. He learned to draw and paint as a child, during a period in which he was bedridden with Kilos\u2019 Malady. As an adult, his illness prevented him from following his mother into service with the UEE Navy, so he joined the UEE Expeditionary Force (UEEEF) as a Field Medic. The UEEEF eventually stationed him on Jalan. He fell in love with the landscape there and was inspired to resume painting. The night of Corath\u2019thal\u2019s descent, Fring was taking an evening walk, having left all his communication devices at his home. As he approached the crest of a hill, he noticed strange lights in the sky, and saw the first of the Tevarin fleet push through the clouds. Fring watched until the last of the ships had either broken apart or crashed. He began work on Tears of Fire the next day.\nThe debut of Tears of Fire at the Gemma Gallery of Art launched Fring\u2019s career as a full-time painter. He went on to produce more pieces centered around the Tevarin Wars, to continual acclaim. His portrait of Corath\u2019thal, referenced from holos and oral descriptions, is noted for its use of smoke and lighting. He died on 11 November 2631 from Kilos-related complications, aged 53 years. Tears of Fire was inducted into the UEE Historical Vault for Antiquity in 2633.\nFring cited human Romantic-era Earth (Sol III) art as one of his primary influences, particularly the use of light and color in Ivan Aivazovsky\u2019s 1848 painting Battle of Chesma. A copy of the painting hung in Fring\u2019s studio. Tears of Fire inspired a revival of Romantic-style art in the UEE, notably pieces with glowing, effusive sources of light.\n",
    "Tedge 8": "The Tedge 8 is a combustion pistol manufactured by Garrity Arms from 2280 to 2516. The Tedge 8 is prized by collectors today and is considered an iconic weapon representative of the early, roughshod era of interstellar colonization. It is a traditional combustion ballistic pistol powered by a disposable neon pressure canister. An unmodified gun has a clip size of eight bullets, though aftermarket modifications can significantly alter this capacity.\n",
    "Teesa Morrison": "Teesa Morrison (SEY 2492 - 2571) was an explorer best known for her discovery of the Baker-Y\u0101'mon jump point. Born on a tanker ship that was passing through the Cano system, she was a self-described \"full-time spacer and explorer\" who funded her expeditions to new or uncharted areas of space by taking odd jobs as needed. While flying through the Baker system in 2531, she detected a signal that she determined to be a jump point after days of analysis. When she completed the jump, her exuberance of discovering what appeared to be an unknown system was short lived when she encountered a Xi'an military unit and was forced to retreat back through the jump tunnel. The United Planets of Earth (UPE) military tried to contain news of the discovery, but a recording of Morrison's encounter leaked to newsorgs and became a major story. Two standard weeks after her initial crossing, a Xi'an scout emerged from the jump point into Baker, nearly sparking a war. With all the increased media attention, rather than fighting, the UPE Navy took a more cautious approach and an outright conflict was avoided. Later, Morrison would use the money awarded her from the UPE government for her discovery to purchase a larger ship, which she made into her permanent home. She died of natural causes in 2571 while traversing the Goss system.\n",
    "Tehachapi": "Tehachapi is a Human producer of defensive combat armor. Their products are marketed as an affordable but sturdy alternative to combat armor produced by companies like ROOK Heavy Metals and Clark Defense Systems. Tehachapi uses a mix of armor plating and a strong polymer weave to reduce its overall weight and keep its cost down.\n",
    "Terminus (Pyro VI)": "Terminus (Pyro VI) is the outermost world of the Pyro system. Its nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere is technically breathable, but contains high enough amounts of methane and carbon dioxide that it has a negative effect on one's health after extended exposure. Pyrotechnic Amalgamated placed their main hub of operations in orbit around Terminus, later abandoning the station when they left the system. Now nicknamed Ruin Station, it has become a flashpoint for power struggles in Pyro. Terminus' proximity to the station has made it the site of frequent clashes between gangs.\n",
    "Terra (Terra III)": "Terra is the third planet from the sun of the Terra system. Naturally habitable, it was colonized shortly after its discovery in 2516 and has since become the most populous planet in the United Empire of Earth (UEE), as well as a center of culture and commerce. Terra's political leaders played key roles in the movement that ended the despotic rule of the Messer Era (2546 - 2792). Today, Terra remains a center of progressive politics, and is home to the Transitionalist political party.\n",
    "Terra Gazette": "The Terra Gazette is a news organization based on Terra (Terra III). Founded in SEY 2521, it is one of the oldest extant news organizations in the Terra system. The Gazette was one of the few major media outlets that attempted to maintain its independence during the Messer Era (2546 - 2792), though it was forced in 2638 to take on a pro-Messer stance. The Terra Gazette\u2019s reporting today leans Transitionalist.\n",
    "Terra Mills (Terragra)": "Terra Mills is a Human manufacturer of consumer foods founded in 2665 on Terra (Terra III). It produces a wide variety of well known brands, such as Pips, Fieldsbury, Prallies, and Big Benny\u2019s. Formerly known as Terragra, the company merged with Bremen Mills in 2717, and the resulting corporate entity was renamed Terra Mills. With the resources of Bremen Mills and Terragra\u2019s distribution network, the company became a dominating force in the market and remains a top food and beverage manufacturer. Terra Mills is one of the largest employers in the Bremen system.\n",
    "Terra System": "The Terra system is a planetary system in the United Empire of Earth (UEE) made up of one mesoplanet, one terrestrial planet, two super-Earths, and one G-type star named Terra Nova. Located at the nexus of seven jump points, the system was first charted in 2516 as part of Project Far Star. It was quickly colonized upon the discovery that the third planet was naturally habitable, and one other planet was located in the green band. The lush and resource-rich planet Terra (Terra III) became a hub of trade and culture, eventually growing in population and prominence to the point that its government was able to maintain a progressive stance even under the rule of the Messers. It continues to be one of the most influential systems in the UEE. The Transitionalist party, based on Terra, believes that the system should be the center of Human government.\n",
    "Terra, Show Me the Music!": "Terra, Show Me the Music! Is a Spectrum show best known for showcasing up and coming musical performers. The series' producers have been credited with discovering many popular entertainers. Performing on the program has helped smaller bands reach larger audiences, such as Saisei-based band The Claw, who found widespread popularity after their appearance on the program in 2932. The \u201cshow\u201d aspect of the title refers to the series' signature electronic visualizations, displayed over the final song performed on a broadcast.\n",
    "Terraformer": "Terraformer is the common name for industrial machinery used to alter the atmosphere and environment of inhospitable worlds in order to make them habitable. The technology can either be orbital platforms or built on the surface of the world itself, but is most often a combination of orbital and terrestrial terraformers. The number and type vary depending on the needs of the particular world that is being terraformed, and must be customized for every project.\n",
    "Terraforming": "Terraforming is the process of rendering an environment habitable for particular inhabitants through the use of industrial technology applied on a planetary scale. Humans have been terraforming worlds since the early 22nd century, allowing for a more rapid expansion into the galaxy than would otherwise be possible. Xi'an have been terraforming since roughly 25400 BCE. Terraforming is an extremely difficult process. When done incorrectly or with substandard materials and processes, it can lead to major disasters. It additionally has a devastating effect on existing flora and fauna on the planet and can lead to mass extinction events.\n",
    "Terrapin": "The Terrapin is a deep-space armored scout ship developed by Anvil Aerospace(Anvil Aerospace) for the United Empire of Earth Navy (UEEN). Outfitted with sensitive scanners, it is used for long duration reconnaissance and leg patrol missions where crewmembers might need to be separated from support facilities for weeks at a time. The spacecraft is encased with heavy armor that allows it to survive skirmishes with lighter raiding craft. The Terrapin was the first military contract awarded to Anvil Aerospace.\n",
    "Terrence Akari": "Terrence Akari (2737 - 2833) was a Senator of Terra (Terra III) who was instrumental in crafting the Akari-Kr.\u0113 Treaty, the first pact of nonaggression between Humans and Xi\u2019an. He was first elected as Senator in 2772, after a decade of work on the Prime city council. A lifelong advocate of peace between Humans and aliens, Akari ran on a platform that promised to ease the tensions between Xi\u2019an and Humans on Terra. In 2789, anti-Messer activists smuggled him to the Tohil system, where he met with Emperor Kr.\u0113 to hammer out the details of the Akari-Kr.\u0113 Treaty. Akari was forced to go into hiding until the events of the Anti-Messer Revolution toppled the Imperator. When the new ImperatorErin Toi offered him a position as ambassador to the Xi\u2019an Empire, Akari chose instead to rejoin with the Senate and work to rebuild the UEE. He helped craft the Fair Chance Act, Military Reorganization Act of 2793, the Historical Truth Act, and many other key pieces of legislation that reshaped the UEE's government. He died in office of natural causes in 2833.\n",
    "Tevarin": "The Tevarin are bipedal beings indigenous to the planet Jalan (Elysium IV); formerly Kaleeth. In 2541, Human researcher Dr. Kellar Lench discovered a jump point into their system. At that time, the Tevarin were capable of space flight, quantum travel, and had highly developed shielding technology. Their society was martial, built around the warrior ethos of Rijora.\nThe Tevarin attacked the United Planets of Earth (UPE) upon first contact and sparked the First Tevarin War(2541-2546), which they eventually lost. Their systems were annexed into the UPE and Humans set up colony towns on the Tevarin homeworld.\nSurviving Tevarin were either absorbed into Human society or spread outwards in a diaspora. After the Second Tevarin War(2603-2610) ended in a similar defeat, the majority of Tevarin renounced their culture in a movement known now as the Tevarin Purge, and fully assimilated into the United Empire of Earth (UEE). As a subset of the UEE, many Tevarin, due to myriad social and economic factors, have historically been involved in the criminal underworld, but a growing number have become involved with public service and a burgeoning cultural revival movement.\n",
    "Tevarin Diaspora": "The Tevarin diaspora refers to the general movement of Tevarin in the centuries following their defeat in the First (2541-2546) and Second (2603-2610) Tevarin Wars. Following the loss of Jalan (Elysium IV) to the United Empire of Earth (UEE) in 2546, the Tevarin that had not already fled the planet were forcefully removed from their homeworld and made to inhabit camps and resettlement communities established throughout the UEE. While many Tevarin were eventually integrated into Human society, others opted to distance themselves from the UEE and form isolated enclaves and communities in less settled areas of the known galaxy, such as the Tevarin settlement on Branaugh II.\n",
    "Tevarin Purge": "The Tevarin Purge was a movement sparked in the immediate aftermath of the Second Tevarin War (2603-2610), in which the Tevarin voluntarily severed connection with their culture. They destroyed records, denounced the Rijoran code, tore down temples, and obliterated other aspects of the civilization that had previously defined and ultimately failed them. Most Tevarin abandoned their homeworld and assimilated into the United Empire of Earth (UEE), and a tiny minority disappeared into unknown parts of space. Most preserved records about the former Tevarin way of life only exist thanks to Human and Xi\u2019an interference. Beginning in the early 30th century, there has been a growing movement among Tevarin to reconnect with their former culture and language.\n",
    "Tevarin-Human First Contact": "Humans and Tevarin first made contact with one another shortly after Dr. Kellar Lench of the New Horizons Research Institute discovered a jump point into the Elysium system. Observing signs that the system was occupied by a technologically advanced civilization, he dispatched a research drone to gather data without disturbing its inhabitants and found a spacefaring people living on Elysium IV. Initial diplomatic attempts by the United Planets of Earth (UPE) first contact team proved unsuccessful. The Tevarin, facing an overpopulation problem due to their lack of terraforming technology, soon attacked the invaders in an effort to take Human colonies in neighboring systems for themselves, sparking the First Tevarin War (2541 - 2546).\n",
    "Th.us'\u016bng I": "Th.us'\u016bng I is the closest planet to the sun of the Th.us'\u016bng system, Xi'an Empire (SaoXy'an). A terrestrial planet, it has a thin mantle that partially exposes its iron core. The Xi'an government prohibits commercial mining on Th.us'\u016bng I, and instead utilizes it as a testing area for mining technology that is designed for hostile environments. In addition, some major Houses have special dispensations to conduct related experiments here under the direct supervision of government representatives.\n",
    "Th.us'\u016bng System": "The Th.us'\u016bng system is a planetary system in the Xi'an Empire, consisting of a G-type main sequence star, three terrestrial planets, one gas giant, one dwarf planet, and one asteroid belt. Discovered in MXY III.802 (SEY 2483) by a scanning drone owned by the Xi'an Service (P\u014d\u2019t.\u014dngp.\u016b), the system was primarily used by the Xi'an government as a testbed for experimental terraforming technology. In MXY III.838 (SEY 2530), Human navjumper Kathryn Segovia discovered the Th.us'\u016bng-Baker jump point and sold its location to the terraforming company Gaia Planet Services (GPS). In order to offset the cost of this purchase, GPS chose not to report the jump point to the United Planets of Earth (UPE). When their surveyors landed on the third world from the system's sun, they were quickly captured by the Xi'an, thus kicking off the events that would start the Xi'an-Human Cold War (MXY III.838 - III.1044 / SEY 2530 - 2793).\n",
    "The Ark": "The Ark is a vast library and archive station located in the United Empire of Earth (UEE)-governed Tayac system. The largest library and archive in the UEE, the Ark houses records, curated information, and artifacts pertaining to the accumulated knowledge of all known spacefaring civilizations. The initial concept for the Ark was presented to the UEE Senate in 2794 by then-Diplomatic Secretary Marshall Leon as a neutral information repository for the benefit of all cultures and civilizations. It was approved the same year and completed in 2800. The Ark Galactapedia and the Ark Starmap are its two most utilized resources.\n",
    "The Claw": "The Claw is a Human band based out of Saisei (Centauri III) in the United Empire of Earth (UEE), credited with popularizing S-pop. In 2932, the band performed a stylized cover of Clover's \u201cMoonlight\u201d on Spectrum show Terra, Show Me the Music! They went on to hold the number one single on multiple music charts for six weeks. Many other S-pop bands signed to major labels in the wake of this success. The band went on indefinite hiatus in 2941.\n",
    "The Coil": "The Coil is an electric phenomenon that exists in the unusually dense asteroid cluster that closely orbits the white dwarf Odin, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Scientists speculate that the Coil phenomenon was created in the aftermath of the star Odin's collapse into a white dwarf. Sometimes called a storm in space, the Coil manifests as lightning bolts that jump from asteroid to asteroid. Lightning from the Coil has been known to destroy spacecraft.\n",
    "The Dark": "The Dark (II.1706 - II.1824; SEY 1305 - 1457) was a period at the end of the Second Imperial Age in which the Xi\u2019an had no ruling Imperial House. Due to the destruction caused by the Spirit Wars (II.961 - II.1735; SEY 351 - 1342), the Xi\u2019an were unable to unify and select a house to succeed the destroyed Imperial House Xy.\u014d. Armed conflict between Houses and assassination of political rivals once again became commonplace. The Dark ended when House Kr.\u0113 was selected as the Third Imperial House in III.0 (SEY 1457)\n",
    "The Gathering": "The Gathering is an irregular meeting of Essosouli held on Bacchus II to discuss issues that have the potential to affect all Banu. Essosouli generally meet two to three times per year, though rarely they will go multiple years without meeting. At each Gathering, legal and trade issues are debated and codified.\n",
    "The Inhabitants of Genesis II": "Genesis II, a richly biodiverse world, is home to at least five species that have evolved to varying stages of development. Two such groups, an ocean-dwelling, cephalopod group and a land-dwelling, avian-reptoid group, are of special interest to observing scientists. Factions of the octopoids have been making incursions onto land, and have engaged in deadly skirmishes with some of the avian-reptoids. Many observers believe this will lead to war. Ethicists, scientists, and academics are embroiled in a debate on whether or not to stop this war before it results in the annihilation of one or more of the groups involved. The Fair Chance Act prohibits outside interference in this development.\n",
    "The Outsiders": "The Outsiders, also known as the Sun's Eye Fellowship, are a religious cult established by Dr. Marcus Fayel that has occupied Mya (Leir II) since the early 2800s. While Fayel oversaw the terraforming of Mya, he cultivated a group of followers and organized an eventual armed takeover of the planet; a feat he achieved in 2812. The Outsiders believe that in order to maintain purity, they must reject all trappings of the modern world, especially the overwhelming consumer culture of the United Empire of Earth (UEE). They say that in order to attain a pure state, one must embrace self-reflection without the smothering distraction of potential societal judgment. The sun is the ultimate example of purity, and is a key part of the meditation necessary on the journey to purity.\n",
    "The Red God (Nexus V)": "Nexus V is a gas giant in the Nexus system, United Empire of Earth (UEE), and is the most distant planet from its sun. Nicknamed \"The Red God\" by locals, its swirling, stormy atmosphere is a mix of swirling shades of red with streaks of dark brown. Although the origin of the name is unknown, the prevailing hypothesis is that it originated with Sang Gestas, an outlaw gang on Lago that believed the planet possessed supernatural powers.\n",
    "Theresa Branaugh": "Theresa Branaugh (2835 - 2873?) was a geologist, surveyor, and explorer best known for her unofficial discovery of the Branaugh system some time before 2877. Like many other explorers, she dreamed of discovering a new planetary system, a goal to which she dedicated all of her time. In order to fund her expeditions, she would regularly borrow from loan sharks, which sometimes led to her fleeing to other systems when repayment was due. Her friends reported her missing in 2873 after she failed to return from an expedition to the Chronos system. Her body was found four years later in a remote cave on Branaugh II by explorer Desmond Fell, near the wreckage of her spacecraft. Although the Advocacy did not identify her killer, they were able to determine that her ship was shot down by someone who was using the area as a hideout. Fell named the system in her honor.\n",
    "Thermal Shielding": "Thermal shielding is a general term for manufactured technology capable of artificially sustaining life in extreme temperature environments. The term can refer to anything from enhanced spacesuit technology that allows EVA work, to the combination of electromagnetic shielding and hull plating necessary for spacecraft to operate near stars or other extreme sources of temperature. Thermal shielding is generally capable of blocking heat, radioactivity and light to varying degrees.\n",
    "Thermyte Concern": "Thermyte Concern is a Human multidisciplinary manufacturer of mining equipment, personal and spacecraft-mounted weaponry, and munitions. Originally founded as a demolition and mining equipment company, Thermyte expanded its reach to weapons and missile warheads in the late 2800s. Its mining division produces some of the largest and most advanced mining heads currently available on the civilian market.\n",
    "Third Imperial Age": "The Third Imperial Age, ruled by House Kr.\u0113, is the Xi\u2019an Empire\u2019s (SaoXy'an) current dynasty. It began in II.1824 (SEY 1457) with the selection of U.e\u2019o se Kr.\u0113 as the new Emperor, roughly a century after the Kr\u2019thak\u2019s assassination of House Xy.\u014d. During this era, the Xi\u2019an formally ended hostilities with the Kr\u2019thak, made first contact with Banu, Vanduul, and Humans, and established diplomatic relationships and opened channels of trade with Banu and Humans. The current Emperor, T.u\u0113ng se Kr.\u0113, was one of the signatories of the Akari-Kr.\u0113 Treaty (III.1040 / SEY 2789), the first nonaggression pact between Humans and Xi\u2019an, an instrumental step in the eventual end of the Xi\u2019an-Human Cold War (III.838 - III.1044 / SEY 2530 - 2793). Because he has no heirs, the Third Imperial Age will end upon his death or abdication, and the Fourth Imperial Age will begin with the selection of a new Imperial House.\n",
    "Thorshu Grey": "The thorshu grey is an omnivorous, six-eyed crustacean indigenous to the cold southern oceans of Terra (Terra III) in the United Empire of Earth (UEE). Considered a delicacy for its tender, sweet meat, it is also a popular aquarium pet, and is one of the more commonly seen animals on shipboard aquatic enclosures.\nThorshu have long, bright orange-red colored carapaces that cover their soft inner bodies, curved upwards into a narrow crescent. They have two dactyls and six walking legs, tipped in sky blue with mottled cream accents. The dark, barnacle-like lumps that grow on their carapaces and front claws may be eyespots, evolved to trick potential predators away from the thorshu\u2019s most vulnerable spots. Thorshu that have more eyespots than others have more success in mating. On average, they grow to between 10 and 20 cm long, and live for around 20 years.\nThough they are largely solitary, thorshu demonstrate complex social behavior in the wild. Upon meeting one another for the first time they engage in ritualized fighting, and ignore one another upon subsequent meetings. They are highly intelligent, able to recognize individual thorshu by scent and color, even if they have not re-encountered each other for several years. Captive thorshu have been known to escape their containers if not provided with stimulating enough environments.\nIn their lifetime, they can breed as many as 30 times. Eggs are laid in burrows dug under seabed rocks. The offspring spend the first few months of their life as microscopic organisms. They molt into their adult form at roughly four months, molting again multiple times until reaching their final size in their third year.\nOn Terra (Terra III), thorshu are commercially bred and raised for their meat. Thousands of tons of whole flash-frozen thorshu are shipped across the UEE every year and sold to high-end restaurants. The leg meat is especially prized for its complex flavor, and is often served hot and dipped in a drawn butter and oza sauce. On Terra, where the thorshu is a conventional catch for local fishers, breaded and fried thorshu claws are a relatively common street food, especially in Quasi.\nThanks to its color, size, and tendency to stay in the open, the thorshu is a favorite denizen of cold saltwater aquariums. It became a fashionable pet in the 27th century after being used as the model for the sidekick character Waka Grey in the children\u2019s show Clawsome. However, its tendency to break out of insecure enclosures and attack brightly colored objects such as decorative glassware put an end to the trend shortly after the show\u2019s final season. It is recommended only for experienced hobbyists.\nThe United Empire of Earth Navy 78th Bomb Squadron, known for its part in Operation Unilateral Force, is nicknamed the \u201cThundering Thorshu.\u201d\n",
    "Tide": "Tide was an anti-Messer resistance movement responsible for airing footage of the Massacre of Garron II to the people of the United Empire of Earth (UEE), thus catalyzing the events that led to the anti-Messer Revolution. Cells of Tide were distributed on most Human-inhabited planets in and around the UEE, especially Rytif (Bremen II), Terra (Terra III), and Tohil III. Their command structure gave each cell individual autonomy while limiting their knowledge of other cells so the organization could not be compromised should a cell be lost. Over the years, the Tide claimed responsibility for staging protests, distributing anti-Messer information, and attempting to emancipate political prisoners. The full extent of their operations were made public after the fall of the Messers. They managed to recruit members of the UEE Senate including Erin Toi, documented atrocities committed by the Messers and even coordinated with Xi'an sympathizers to smuggle political activists through Xi'an space. Tide's contacts within SSN/CAtv helped them interrupt Spectrum broadcasts on 11 April 2792, sparking a direct coup against ImperatorLinton Messer XI.\n",
    "Titan": "The Titan is a variant of the Avenger patrol ship developed by Aegis Dynamics. Designers stripped much of the standard Avenger's rear cabin to create a dedicated cargo space. This additional capacity allows the variant to be used in a support role by the United Empire of Earth Navy (UEEN) and by independent operators who prefer to operate a freighter that carries a weapons and armor package by default. A limited edition, the Titan Renegade, was created by Aegis in conjunction with the makers of the flight-sim Arena Commander.\n",
    "Titania Terraforming": "Titania Terraforming was a terraforming company most notable for their failure to terraform Uriel (Oberon II) in the unclaimed Oberon system. Founded in 2333, it was primarily contracted by larger conglomerates for piecework until it successfully placed the winning bid for the coordinates to the newly-discovered Oberon-Nul jump point. Since so much of their budget was spent on the contract, the company chose to offset future operating costs by selling low-price plots of land on the yet-to-be-terraformed Oberon II. Thousands of people signed on and headed to Oberon, not knowing that the neutron star at the heart of the system made terraforming unlikely at best. When Titania Terraforming failed to make the planet livable, they abandoned the people they had sold land to and immediately folded.\n",
    "Titus Costigan": "Titus Costigan (2909 - present) is the CEO of Esrua Industries, director of the nonprofit Better Together Foundation, and eldest son of former ImperatorKelos Costigan of the United Empire of Earth (UEE). Running as a Universalist, he was one of five final candidates for the office of Imperator in 2950. His platform included promises to increase economic activity by relaxing regulations on businesses, increase funding for the Militia Mobilization Initiative, and improve transparency on how Synthworld funds are being spent. In the leadup to the final election, multiple attack ads were released by an unknown party tying Costigan to a multi-system drug syndicate. Costigan\u2019s campaign refused to respond.\n",
    "Tohil Belt Alpha": "The Tohil belt alpha is an asteroid belt in the Tohil system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Dense with asteroids, travel conditions through it are dangerous enough that major mining companies in the UEE have declined to begin operations there. Smugglers and other outlaws who are especially skilled at piloting and navigation have been known to hide in the belt, but most choose not to risk their ships and lives and give it a wide berth.\n",
    "Tohil I": "Tohil I is the innermost planet of the Tohil system, United Empire of Earth (UEE), and is tidally locked to its sun. Close proximity to the star has turned the day side of Tohil I into an ocean of lava. Surveys indicate that the molten rock extends deep within the planet, nearly reaching its core. As it stretches near the solar terminator, the lava becomes increasingly sluggish until it eventually solidifies.\n",
    "Tohil II": "Tohil II is a planet in the Tohil system, United Empire of Earth (UEE), and is the second world from its sun. A mesoplanet, its mantle has been stripped away over many millennia due to intense solar winds. During the Messer Era (2546 - 2792), smugglers would sometimes hide in the shadow of Tohil II if they came too close to being caught by government agents. It is rumored that there were at one point dozens of smuggler drops hidden away on the planet's surface, some of which still remain in active use.\n",
    "Tohil III": "Tohil III is a planet in the Tohil system, United Empire of Earth (UEE) and is the third world from its sun. Naturally habitable, it is an ocean world that supports massive botanical biomasses that sit atop the water and create floating islands. Smugglers frequently utilized Tohil III as a hideout and drop spot throughout the later years of the Messer Era (2546 - 2792). In 2789, Senator Terrence Akari of Terra (Terra III) and Emperor T.u\u0113ng se Kr.\u0113 of the Xi'an Empire (SaoXy'an) chose Tohil III as their meeting spot to negotiate what would become the first peace treaty between Humans and Xi'an.\n",
    "Tohil IV": "Tohil IV is a planet in the Tohil system, United Empire of Earth (UEE), and is the fourth world from its sun. A massive super-Earth, Tohil IV exerts a strong gravitational pull that attracts frequent meteor and comet strikes. Deep craters pockmark its surface, some of which were utilized by anti-Messer revolutionaries during the final years of the Messer Era (2546 - 2792) as clandestine transfer spots for political refugees fleeing to safety.\n",
    "Tohil System": "The Tohil system is a planetary system in the United Empire of Earth (UEE) that consists of a K-type main sequence star, two terrestrial planets, a mesoplanet, and a super-Earth. Discovered in SEY 2716 by smugglers Oisha Suen and Aadya Firmino, it was added to the Perry Line in 2719 when the UEE Navy located a jump point to the system from Oya. Named Tohil after an ancient Human war deity, it became a popular smuggling route after the UEE relocated its military forces to the Castra system. In 2789, Senator Terrence Akari of Terra (Terra III) and Emperor T.u\u0113ng se Kr.\u0113 met on Tohil III in secret and negotiated the first peace treaty between Humans and Xi'an. The Akari-Kr.\u0113 Treaty contributed to the growing instability of the Messer government and helped bring an end to the Xi'an-Human Cold War (2530 - 2793).\n",
    "Torral Aggregate (Ao\u014d\u2019nu se T.or\u2019al)": "Torral Aggregate (Ao\u014d\u2019nu se T.or\u2019al) is a Xi'an weapons manufacturer and House with a history of weapons production under auspice of the Emperor that dates back thousands of years. They produce a significant number of weapons and related systems for the Xi'an military. In recent years, they have begun to export products adapted for Human use. Weapons available for sale directly to Humans include the Yeng'tu laser repeater (ro\u2019thli Yeng\u2019tu), which was first mounted on the San'tok.y\u0101i fighter, and the Kahix missile launcher (ro\u2019noy.ithly\u2019ehung K\u0113\u2019hith).\n",
    "Touvoni/Aiya (Charon 3a)": "Touvoni (Charon 3a) is the moon of Charon III, United Empire of Earth (UEE), known as Aiya in Dellin. After Tarquin Klast was elected governor of Dellin in 2944, he passed a popular decree renaming the moon to differentiate the values of Dellin from the other states on Charon III. All other states on the planet still call the moon Touvoni.\n",
    "Tradeway": "Tradeways are ports of entry maintained by the United Empire of Earth (UEE) for the purpose of exchanging goods with other civilizations such as the Banu Protectorate or the Xi'an Empire. UEE tradeways are maintained by a combination of Human customs officials and representatives of the bordering nation. A major tradeway with the Banu Protectorate is located in the Corel System, the point through which the majority of legally processed goods transit between Banu and Humans.\n",
    "Tram": "Tram is the largest city on Asura (Ferron III), United Empire of Earth (UEE). It was the financial and cultural center of Asura\u2019s thriving economy until the mining crash in the early 2800s caused widespread economic collapse. Many of its buildings were abandoned as the majority of its population fled, and have been allowed to deteriorate. Today, drinking water shortages are common in some areas due to the failure of old infrastructure and source contamination issues. Pollution poses a continual hazard to those unwilling or unable to relocate. There has been a recent effort among some architecture historians to preserve some of the grand old buildings erected during the city\u2019s heyday.\n",
    "Transitionalist Party": "The Transitionalist party is one of the three major political parties in the United Empire of Earth (UEE). Formed on Terra (Terra III), the core ideologies of the Transitionalist party support measures that decentralize UEE governmental power, raise government spending towards education and the sciences, increase taxes on the wealthy, and fund exploration. Many Transitionalists support moving the capital of the UEE away from Earth (Sol III) to Terra.\n",
    "Traveler's Day": "Traveler\u2019s Day is an annual holiday observed by the Church of the Journey on January 1st. It originated in the Croshaw system in 2905 when a small gathering of Journeymen who had grown up together convened to exchange their experiences over the previous year. They repeated their actions the following year, and the next, wherever they were, thus spreading the practice until it became tradition. Traveler\u2019s Day activities include storytelling, a potluck feast, games, and a 20 km walk known as the Pilgrimage that begins at midnight local time. At the end of the walk, stories are swapped until sunrise. The largest Traveler\u2019s Day gathering in the United Empire of Earth (UEE) occurs in New Arden on Cestulus (Davien II), attracting thousands of visitors annually.\n",
    "Tribunal": "The Tribunal is an executive governing body in the United Empire of Earth (UEE). It is made up of a High-Secretary, responsible for infrastructure; High-Command, a three-person position responsible for managing each of the military branches; and a High-Advocate, responsible for law enforcement. The Tribunal was initially formed alongside the United Planets of Earth but was eliminated when Ivar Messer I first took power. The Tribunal was reinstated by the UEE Senate and ImperatorErin Toi in 2792.\n",
    "Trident Attack Systems": "Trident Attack Systems is a Human company that manufactures energy weapons. Founded in 2803, the company\u2019s original lineup of weapons was predominantly ballistic focused, but when they scaled up their operations in 2821 they pivoted to focus exclusively on energy weapons as a cost-saving measure. The Arame laser beam is considered the company's current flagship product.\n",
    "Triggerfish": "Triggerfish is a Human holiday celebrated annually in the United Empire of Earth (UEE) on 01 April. Those who observe it play pranks and jokes on one another or participate in hoaxes, shouting \u201cTriggerfish!\u201d once a jape is complete. Though the holiday has origins stretching as far back as the 16th century, it first began to be called Triggerfish in the 2600s, when it became tradition for residents of Borea (Magnus II) to try and convince visitors that a secret fourth planet named \u201cTriggerfish\u201d existed in the Magnus system. Some outlaws would give victims coordinates to the planet, only to ambush them once they arrived. To put an end to this dangerous practice, the UEE launched an information campaign refuting the claim that Triggerfish existed. This spread the name outside its system of origin. Triggerfish became a nickname for a gullible person, and the name became the most common way to refer to the holiday.\n",
    "Trise Cordial": "Trise Cordial is an herb liqueur 55% alcohol by volume (ABV) adapted from the Banu drink otisau falu for safe Human consumption. Introduced to the market in 2789, it has an herbal flavor profile with pungent notes of salammoniac. The original Banu version of the drink is distilled from both water and ammonia-based herbs grown on Trise I, and is poisonous to Humans.\nTrise Cordial has a strong, characteristic taste: bitter and herbal with a sweet undercurrent as it contacts the palate, followed by salammoniac with a hint of pine upon swallowing. It is often served at room temperature in a cordial glass as an aperitif. Trise Cordial is used as an ingredient in place of bitters in some cocktails, such as the whiskey-based Trise Sling, a drink first made popular at the G-Loc Bar in Area18 on ArcCorp (Stanton III). Clair Rios of Cafe Musain in the Nyx system takes credit for the recipe, claiming that bartenders working for G-Loc stole it when they passed through Delamar in 2911.\nWhile the origin of otisau falu is not known, it has been consumed by Banu at least since Humans first made contact with them in the early 25th century. Although many safe Banu products entered the United Empire of Earth (UEE) around this time, otisau falu was banned in 2445 after three Humans were accidentally poisoned from a Slomaddon containing the drink. It wasn\u2019t until 2789 that it became available, when a distillery Souli on the Bacchus flotilla hit upon a Human-safe version of the cordial with little alteration to the flavor. It attracted a small but dedicated following among Humans who would visit the flotilla and bring bottles back with them to the UEE. Eventually the drink became popular enough that the Souli was able to take its profits and move to Trise I, where it could have more immediate and inexpensive access to the herbs. In 2802, it caught the attention of the Terran Liquor Group (TLG), a distributor based on Terra (Terra III).\nSensing opportunity, the corporation sent representatives to the Souli that created the beverage to strike a distribution deal. Under the terms of the contract, TLG would handle marketing, bottling, and label design, and the Souli would handle distillation. To market the new drink, TLG embellished its origins with a story of ascetic Banu living spiritual lives on Trise I who produce the liqueur as a form of prayer. To further emphasize this connection, they named it Trise Cordial.\nSales went well for five years, until the Essosouli of the original Souli Divested and the Souli dissolved. New Soulis founded by former members of the old distillery Souli popped up, all making their own versions of Trise Cordial. After a long negotiation period, TLG extended its distribution deal to the newly founded Soulis; a practice that they continued until 2834, when inconsistencies among the various batches forced the company to distill the liqueur itself to maintain a consistent product.\nDespite TLG employing Banu distillers and using ingredients grown on Trise I, many connoisseurs of otisau falu claim that the current Trise Cordial recipe is a poor imitation of the authentic version. A small market for artisanal Souli-distilled versions of the drink has arisen. However, TLG\u2019s Trise Cordial remains the best-selling and most well-known version of the liqueur in the UEE.\n",
    "Truth and Reconciliation Commission": "The Truth and Reconciliation Commission was a formal committee convened by the United Empire of Earth (UEE) to declassify unlawful acts committed by members of the government during and leading up to the Messer Era (SEY 2546 - 2792). Formed in 2806, the Commission made thousands of personal and official records available to the public. The Commission was disbanded in 2810.\n",
    "Tumbril Land Systems": "Tumbril Land Systems is a terrestrial vehicle manufacturer that reformed in 2941 after first closing in 2862. Originally founded on Yar (Centauri II) in 2536, its first product was the DX20, a wheeled vehicle designed by founders Kavya Crosby and Aaron Douze. Due to the DX20's success, Tumbril became a military contractor during the First Tevarin War (2541-2546) where it became a fixture of the military. After the fall of the Messers in 2792, its military contracts were drastically reduced. The company declared bankruptcy in 2862. In 2941, DevCo Group purchased the Tumbril name and resurrected the brand and its designs, updating them for the 30th century. The new Tumbril Land Systems launch line up included the Cyclone armored ground vehicle and Nova battle tank.\n",
    "Turiya Terraforming": "Turiya Terraforming was a terraforming company most notable for winning the contract from the United Nations of Earth (UNE) to spearhead development of the Oretani system. Under CEO Adriana Bratanek, Turiya's policy was to house their employees and their families for free under the condition that they relocate to the newly-terraformed planet once work was complete. After an expansive advertising campaign, the company attracted thousands of workers to the Oretani system and began work in 2483. In 2485, amidst rumors of food shortages on the space stations and a sense of unrest among the workers at the lack of available land on Oretani II, Bratanek invited reporters to tour operations in Oretani. Two days later, the Ferron-Oretani jump point suddenly collapsed, cutting everyone inside the system off from the rest of the UNE. Turiya's remaining board members filed to dissolve the corporation in 2496.\n",
    "Tyrol Belt Alpha": "The Tyrol belt alpha is an asteroid belt in the unclaimed Tyrol system. Located between the third and fourth planets from its two suns, the belt was once situated within the temperate green band, which shifted outwards when the F-type star entered its subgiant phase. Some of the asteroids in the belt are sublimating, and display cometary dust trails when they reach perihelion.\n",
    "Tyrol I": "Tyrol I is the first planet from the two suns of the unclaimed Tyrol system. In close orbit around the barycenter of the binary stars, its proximity to them has led to a dangerously hot environment. Nevertheless, the surface is home to an ever-shifting group of squatters who drift on and off the planet. They mostly inhabit former research stations or mining facilities that were built to withstand the extreme heat. When the systems that keep these locations safe fail, people must flee to safer ground or risk death by hyperthermia.\n",
    "Tyrol II": "Tyrol II is a terrestrial planet in the unclaimed Tyrol system, and is the second world from its two suns. An iron planet, it is composed mainly of heavy metals, and has only a scant silicate surface. Scientists believe that Tyrol I once had a thick crust and mantle that was stripped away due to an unknown event. Wide, dark plains on its surface suggest that it briefly had multiple lava oceans.\n",
    "Tyrol III": "Tyrol III is a coreless terrestrial planet in the unclaimed Tyrol system. Third from its suns, it is distant enough from them that it is overall cooler than Tyrol I and Tyrol II, although still very hot. Thanks to the absence of a metallic core at the center, it lacks an electromagnetic field and has failed to maintain a protective atmosphere. In 2911, Tyrol III was the subject of a University of Rhetor research project on the formation of coreless planets.\n",
    "Tyrol IV": "Tyrol IV is a chthonian planet in the unclaimed Tyrol system, and is the fourth world from its two suns. Dense and rich in minerals, it is a popular destination for local miners seeking to strike it rich. However, its high gravity creates a working environment that takes a harsh toll on people's bodies over time. Local folklore supposes that some of the mines are haunted by the ghosts of those who became too exhausted by the strain to return to their ships.\n",
    "Tyrol System": "The Tyrol system is an unclaimed planetary system that consists of a binary star system, four terrestrial planets, a chthonian planet, a gas giant, and a protoplanet. Discovered by Damon Huerta in 2823, it was initially met with excitement until it became clear that the F-type star had just entered its subgiant phase and was slowly losing its outer atmosphere to its companion star, a white dwarf. At some point within the next few hundred years, the hydrogen accreted by the smaller star will undergo fusion into helium and cause a nova; a cataclysmic explosion that has the potential to wipe out the entire system. Tyrol has remained mostly unsettled beyond those interested in studying the building nova up close, those who wish to live outside the boundaries of the United Empire of Earth (UEE), and those who have no other choice.\n",
    "Tyrol V": "Tyrol V is a terrestrial planet in the unclaimed Tyrol system. Fifth position from its two suns, it was once partially covered in a thick layer of water ice that melted when the F-type star entered its subgiant phase and forced the green band outward. This created thousands of large lakes and revealed vast chasms, canyons, and caverns generated by millennia of glaciers. The presence of water on the planet has led to the creation of the largest settlement in the system, Haven.\n",
    "Tyrol VI": "Tyrol VI is a gas giant in the unclaimed Tyrol system. The sixth world from its two suns, it remained largely unaffected when the F-type star entered its subgiant phase. Rain inside the atmosphere of Tyrol VI is composed of helium. During precipitation, the helium droplets fall through the liquid hydrogen of the planet's interior, where they dissolve in the heat. Helium clouds contribute to the atmosphere's pale color.\n",
    "Tyrol VII": "Tyrol VII is a protoplanet in the unclaimed Tyrol system, and is the outermost planet in the system. In 2943, a widely-reported academic article claimed that Tyrol VII was far enough from its two suns that it had a high chance of remaining out of danger in the event of a nova. Since then, multiple institutes of higher learning and private research organizations have expressed interest in constructing a permanent base on the planet from which to observe the nova's progress.\n",
    "UEE Army": "The United Empire of Earth Army (UEEA) is the branch of the UEE military responsible for land-based military operations. Headquartered on Earth (Sol III), It was founded alongside the UEE Navy (UEEN) in 2380 as a part of the creation of the United Nations of Earth (UNE). The Army is represented by the Legatus Exercitus, one of three members of the High-Command responsible for interpreting and facilitating the Imperator\u2019s orders.\n",
    "UEE Diplomatic Corps": "The United Empire of Earth Diplomatic Corps (UEEDC or more commonly DC) is an agency of the UEE government responsible for diplomatic efforts associated with other civilizations. It works with the Imperator, Senate, and various agencies and departments to develop treaties, oversee trade agreements, and maintain embassies with the Xi'an Empire and the Banu Protectorate. First contact protocols for meeting new civilizations are under the purview of the Diplomatic Corps. While the Diplomatic Corps is a civilian agency, it is closely supported by the military; in particular, the UEE Navy often assigns capital ships to serve as diplomatic flags for missions that require the transportation of diplomats outside UEE borders.\n",
    "UEE Navy": "The United Empire of Earth Navy (UEEN) is the largest branch of the Human armed forces. It is responsible for the operation of Human capital ships, support craft, and fighters and the maintenance thereof. The UEE Navy is headed by the Legatus Navium, who represents the branch in the military High Command. It is headquartered at MacArthur (Kilian V) in the Kilian system. The Navy is responsible for operations outside of UEE territory in a time of war and acting as an additional security presence to support law enforcement within the UEE\u2019s borders.\n",
    "UEES Flyssa": "The UEES Flyssa was a Javelin-class destroyer that crashed on the surface of Daymar (Stanton 2b) in 2862 and was last commanded by Captain Chin Ormiston of the United Empire of Earth (UEE)Navy. Launched in 2779 after a three year construction process, it was initially used as a patrol ship in systems near Vanduul territory under Captain Thembeka Muholi. It intercepted and destroyed three Vanduul Blades in the Odin system in 2801, and participated in a reconnaissance mission to Vanduul space in 2819. After Muholi\u2019s retirement in 2857, the Flyssa was assigned to the Stanton system under the command of Captain Chin Ormiston. The Flyssa was fatally damaged by the explosion of a fleeing spacecraft during an operation to remove illegal miners from Daymar. The resultant shower of debris and ore fragments shredded the thrusters, causing an overload when the Captain ordered a retreat. The Flyssa then careened onto the surface of the moon below. All 65 souls aboard perished.\n",
    "UEES Olympus": "The UEES Olympus was a Navy carrier that crash landed on the unclaimed planet Ashana (Nul V) in 2571 while pursuing a group of pirates. After the Human government decided against sending in a cleanup crew, a scavenger camp formed among the wreckage. Today, the remains of the Olympus are the heart of a town of the same name.\n",
    "Ui'r.a'ang (Kai'pua I)": "Ui'r.a'ang (Kai'pua I) is the first planet from the sun of the Kai'pua system, Xi'an Empire (SaoXy'an). Composed mainly of carbon, it is a terrestrial planet with black, brown, and red hued atmosphere. The temperatures and pressure in the planet's interior may have caused the formation of abundant diamonds beneath the surface. However, the Xi'an government prohibits mining, so this hypothesis remains unproven.\n",
    "UltiFlex": "UltiFlex is a Human manufacturer of basic survival tools and handheld weaponry. The company has been producing combat knives under contract for the United Empire of Earth (UEE) Army since the 2500s, and sells civilian versions of their products for the mass market. The UltiFlex name is synonymous with their flagship product, the FSK-8 Combat Knife. These combat knives are part of the standard field kit for UEE soldiers and are popular among civilian survivalists.\n",
    "Ulysses Messer X": "Ulysses Messer X (2702-2781) was Imperator of the United Empire of Earth (UEE) from 2751-2781. Before becoming Imperator, he served as High-Secretary under his uncle Galor IX from 2722, overseeing the reconstruction of government buildings in the Meta-Baroque style of architecture. As Galor IX's health declined, Ulysses took on more and more of his day-to-day duties. After taking office in 2751, Ulysses directed most of the UEE's resources into completing the reconstruction project. During his time as Imperator, he stripped down environmental protections, raised taxes, lowered the minimum working age to 10, decreased government oversight of industry, suspended minimum wage, expanded police powers, rewrote treason laws, and enacted mass deregulations. His son, Linton XI, staged a coup in 2781. Ulysses X committed suicide before Linton XI's agents could reach him.\n",
    "Unclaimed System": "An unclaimed system is a term used primarily in the United Empire of Earth (UEE) to describe a planetary system that has not been annexed or otherwise claimed by any type of formal government. Because these systems are not under the jurisdiction of any body of law, some unclaimed systems become havens for activity that would be seen as criminal elsewhere.\n",
    "Unification Wars": "The Unification Wars were a series of wars that took place after the formation of the United Nations of Earth (UNE) in 2380 until 2384. It was sparked on 20 October 2380 when the crew of the Stanley, a warship registered to the former country of Amecanio, mutinied and threatened to attack multiple cities on Earth (Sol III) unless the government reverted to its pre-unified form. The UNE Council mobilized the military and successfully disabled and recaptured the Stanley; however, six more warships rebelled and fighting broke out in earnest. Although the first war ended with the defeat of anti-unificationists in early 2381, a second war erupted that same year when the UNE Army clashed with separatist rebels who had created fortifications in the Mars (Sol IV) frontier. The third and final war concluded on 29 July 2384 in the skies above New York City. Anti-unificationists who did not surrender fled the Sol system, and many went on to form outlaw gangs.\n",
    "Unified Currency Riot": "The Unified Currency Riot was a two-week period of political unrest and violence in Jata, Cestulus (Davien II) in 2529 following the introduction of the United Earth Credit (UEC) to the United Planets of Earth (UPE) market. The riot began when a private security officer discharged his weapon into a protesting crowd on the steps of the local SSN/CAtv headquarters. Hundreds were injured in the subsequent riots and several died when the UPE military ultimately intervened, bringing two weeks of looting, vandalism, and property destruction to an end.\n",
    "United Empire of Earth": "The United Empire of Earth (UEE) is the name of the current Human governmental body. It is led by a democratically elected Imperator; a Tribunal of High-Advocate, High-Secretary, and High-Command; and a legislative body (UEE Senate) composed of elected representatives from Human-controlled planets. The UEE was formed after the conclusion of the First Tevarin War in the 26th century. Then-High-General Ivar Messer claimed that the Tribunal system and Senate were rendered ineffective by bureaucracy and introduced the concept of Prime Citizen, a singular figurehead of the government to unclog the perceived governmental quagmire. Once elected, he stripped the United Planets of Earth's High-Secretary and High-Advocate of their office and utilized the power of the military to declare himself Imperator for life. Descendants of Messer reigned as dictators for centuries, modifying and corrupting the governmental system to further ensconce their power. In 2792, they were ousted from power in a popular uprising which instated the current democratic government structure.\n",
    "United Empire of Earth Citizen": "A Citizen is a resident of the United Empire of Earth (UEE) who has actively taken a role in making the UEE better. Often this can be achieved through military service, the performance of exemplary community service, or success in a government-proctored application. Citizens of the UEE are afforded some privileges that civilians are not afforded, including the ability to run for a seat on the UEE Senate, apply to work for the UEE government, attain the office of Imperator, and the reception of a special dispensation to pay lower tax rates.\n",
    "United Empire of Earth Civilian": "A civilian is a resident of the United Empire of Earth (UEE) who has not taken the steps to become a Citizen. At the age of 17 SEY, a civilian can own property, can vote in local elections and legislation, and must start paying taxes. All civilians are eligible to hold planetary-level political office. Civilians cannot serve on the UEE Senate seat or be elected to the office of Imperator. Although not afforded some of the privileges of Citizens, civilians are still protected members of the UEE.\n",
    "United Empire of Earth Governor": "A United Empire of Earth Governor is the elected executive leader of a State or territory in the United Empire of Earth (UEE) planet. It can be filled by Citizens or Civilians, and is the highest-ranking government position a Civilian can attain. The position is limited to two six-year terms. A Governor oversees an area of land on a planet that is run by one hundred Representatives who are assigned to various committees and departments that oversee and regulate planetary infrastructure. A planet can have two or more Governors depending on the size of its population and number of states. Densely populated planets may have dozens of Governors.\n",
    "United Empire of Earth Governors Council": "The United Empire of Earth Governors Council is the ruling body of a UEE planet. Each elected Governor representing a State or territory of the planet serves on the Governors Council to create planet-wide laws, settle disputes, and discuss worldwide issues that may affect their constituents. The Governors Council also has the ability to petition the UEE for official recognition.\n",
    "United Empire of Earth Imperator": "The Imperator is the democratically elected head of government in the United Empire of Earth (UEE). Bills and legislation that start in the Senate and that have been approved by the High-Secretary move up to the Imperator for approval or veto. Imperators may serve single ten-year term limits. It is the highest office that a Citizen of the UEE can obtain. The position was created by Ivar Messer in 2546 and was initially an inherited office in the Messer Era.\n",
    "United Empire of Earth Representative": "A Representative is an elected official that serves under a Governor on a United Empire of Earth (UEE) planet. Their chief duties are overseeing departments and committees that regulate their state\u2019s infrastructure. The amount of Representatives assigned to each state is determined by the population of each state. Every ten years, the population census dictates whether the number of Representatives can rise or fall. Both Civilians and Citizens are able to serve in this role.\n",
    "United Nations of Earth": "The United Nations of Earth (UNE) was the first Human unified government, founded in 2380, shortly after the first planet outside the Sol system was successfully terraformed. The world leaders of the time decided that Humanity's expansion into space would be better managed by a unified government. Existing countries formed the first Senate and supervised the first major terraforming boom in Human history and the first diasporas from Earth. It was peacefully reformed as the United Planets of Earth in 2523.\n",
    "United Planets of Earth": "The United Planets of Earth was the name of the Human government from 2523 to 2546. It was led by a Tribunal composed of a High-Advocate, a High-General, and a High-Secretary along with a Senate populated by elected representatives from all Human-controlled planetary systems. During this time, Humans introduced a unified currency, made first contact with the Xi\u2019an and Tevarin, and engaged in the First Tevarin War(2541-2546). Ivar Messer I\u2019s ascendancy to Prime Citizen in 2546 marked the end of the era as he transitioned the government into the United Empire of Earth.\n",
    "United Resource Workers": "The United Resource Workers are an interplanetary guild of resource collectors such as asteroid miners and gas scoopers in the United Empire of Earth (UEE). The guild was founded in 2112 to protect the rights of workers, from ensuring safer and better work practices to securing a living wage. Its motto is \"Solidarity Conquers Adversity.\"\n",
    "Universal Body Armor (UBA)": "Universal Body Armor, commonly referred to as UBA, is a Human manufacturer of personal armor. UBA was initially formed as a holding company. It gradually acquired small armor manufacturers until it had the capacity to offer a unified product across the United Empire of Earth (UEE). The company's focus on streamlined mass-production allows it to offer affordable armor intended to be easily worn, but typically does not have the protection of industrial or military-grade suits.\n",
    "Universalist Party": "The Universalist party is one of the three major political parties in the United Empire of Earth (UEE). The core ideologies of the Universalist party support measures for the expansion of government power, increasing government regulation, decreasing taxes on the wealthy, cutting government expenditures, and supporting free trade. The most recent Universalist Imperator of the UEE was Kelos Costigan, who served from 2941 to 2951.\n",
    "University of Lo New Junction (ULON)": "The University of Lo, New Junction (ULON) is a small public university in New Junction, Lo (Corel III), United Empire of Earth (UEE). In 2859, it was founded thanks to a large donation from Shubin Interstellar. ULON offers a wide variety of two year and four year degrees, but is best known for its geotechnology program, which confers professional certifications in fields related to terraforming and economics. The school is a member of a consortium of educational institutes dedicated to advancing the field of planetary technology. Nearly all applicants who reside on Lo are automatically accepted and given a discounted tuition rate in the interest of bettering the community.\n",
    "University of Mentor": "The University of Mentor (UM) is a public research university on Mentor (Rhetor IV), United Empire of Earth (UEE). The school is one of several prestigious universities located in the Rhetor system. Established shortly after the planet was terraformed, it is the oldest and largest institute of higher learning on Mentor. Its physical sciences and history programs are highly competitive, with 5 to 10% admissions rates for new students. UM\u2019s reputation for rigorous, demanding study coupled with Mentor\u2019s frigid environment may factor into the school\u2019s relatively high dropout rate. The University of Mentor is responsible for maintenance and research efforts connected with the UEE's universal seed vaults.\n",
    "University of Persei": "The University of Persei is the oldest continually operating institute of higher education in the Rhetor system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). It is a collegiate research university made up of several semi-independent colleges and research institutes, including the University of Persei Analytical Research and Quantification (UPARQ) center. As a part of an agreement between the Earth (Sol III) government and the discoverers of the system, land on Persei (Rhetor II) was explicitly reserved for public education, and the University of Persei was soon established. The school is best known for its programs in space technology, terraforming, and psychology.\n",
    "University of Rhetor": "The University of Rhetor is a public institute of higher learning located on Reisse (Rhetor III) in the Rhetor system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). A research university, it offers a wide range of subjects and invests heavily in research and development. It was founded in 2389 by a group of scholars who left the University of Persei following a dispute over the low salaries of adjunct professors. Undergraduates at the school take four courses per semester and are required to engage in experiential education, which can include civic engagement, hands-on professional engagement, and one or more semesters studying abroad.\n",
    "Untold Tales": "Untold Tales is a Spectrum show hosted by Saanvi Tejwani that recounts and explores a single real-world mystery to the audience. The format varies depending on the subject. An episode may present actual footage or re-enactments of incidents to examine a mystery, coupled with interviews with involved individuals or commentary from experts. Cold cases, supernatural phenomena, unexpected alien discoveries, missing persons, and unexplained historical events are the most common topics. The show's introductory monologue has become an element of popular culture, especially the final line, \"These are the universe's Untold Tales,\" or \"This is Untold Tales.\"\nEach episode of Untold Tales opens with a montage composed of footage, images, and re-enactments that will be used in the episode, over which the host recites a monologue expounding on the unexplained happenings of the universe. Usually one mystery is covered, but sometimes up to three are explored in depth. At the end of each episode, the host wraps things up by asking unanswered questions raised by the mystery, inviting the viewers to solve it if they can. If a cold case was the main focus, the host asks the audience to contact the show if they have any information that will help bring the perpetrator to justice.\nUntold Tales began as a series of seven specials hosted by Ellroy Cass and Saanvi Tejwani beginning in 2945, covering famous paranormal phenomena throughout the UEE, such as the Hades cryptid and the lost civilization of Terra (Terra III). The specials earned high ratings, so much so that the producers ordered a full-fledged series. At first, the plan was to continue with two hosts, but Cass declined to sign the contract when they accepted a starring role in the then-upcoming film Crimson Tower. Production continued, and the first episode debuted in mid-2945 with Tejwani at the helm. It covered the 2711 unsolved robbery of the Greater Davien Bank and Trust, the mystery of the empty starliner Gisele Tamar discovered drifting near Abyss (Orion IV) in 2903, and reported ghost sightings near the site of the long-since-collapsed Oretani jump point.\nTejwani's grave yet dramatic narration style quickly became synonymous with the show. Apparel featuring her signature line \"These are the universe's Untold Tales,\" sold out in its first run on Voyager Direct. When Tejwani took a leave of absence for personal reasons in 2947, ratings experienced a sharp drop, only to recover when Tejwani returned late that same year.\nViewers are occasionally given updates when a case is solved. Most famously, missing person and former child star Eliu Jalan Cervantes, abducted in 2940, was found living on Delamar in the Nyx system in 2948 under the assumed name Uriel Kane thanks to an anonymous tip from viewers. His manager Liberato Kane was arrested and convicted of the kidnapping, and Cervantes returned to his family.\n",
    "UPARQ": "University of Persei Analytical Research and Quantification (UPARQ) is a research center headquartered on Persei (Rhetor II), sponsored by the United Empire of Earth (UEE). The researchers at UPARQ work largely on classified projects for the benefit of the UEE military. Due to its connections with the UEE government, public access to UPARQ is strictly controlled.\n",
    "Upsana Dixit": "Upsana Dixit (2491-2563) was a Human journalist, news anchor, showrunner, and Spectrum show host. Born in 2491 in Quinton, Angeli (Croshaw II), she created Showdown! in 2511 as a 30-minute long current events debate audio program. After amassing a significant following, it was purchased by SSN/CAtv and converted to a Spectrum broadcast show in 2521. Dixit impartially moderated Showdown! until she retired in 2546 in protest of Ivar Messer I's rise to power. She died at age 72 in an earthquake in her hometown Quinton in 2563.\n",
    "Uriel (Oberon II)": "Uriel is the second planet from the neutron star in the unclaimed Oberon system. Before the formation of the United Nations of Earth (UNE), there were few regulations on the discovery of new systems. When Titania Terraforming won the coordinates of Oberon in an auction, they sold plots of land on Uriel to offset the future costs of terraforming the planet. However, the company failed to completely terraform the planet and stranded the newly-arrived colonists, who were forced to establish settlements underground in order to survive the cold and hostile world. Today, while there are some above-ground structures, the vast majority of people on Uriel live in a warren of interconnected, underground towns organized around familial lineages that can be traced back to the world's original settlers.\n",
    "Ursa Rover": "The Ursa Rover is an all-terrain exploration vehicle developed by Roberts Space Industries (RSI), designed for ground-based scouting, mapping, and discovery applications. Though RSI is primarily a spacecraft manufacturer, they opted to tackle design and production of the Ursa internally in order to support their Constellation multi-crew spacecraft. Anvil Aerospace has also included the Ursa under license with their Carrack-class explorer. The Ursa Rover Fortuna, a version of the Ursa with green livery, was available for a limited time.\n",
    "Valakkar": "The valakkar is a colossal worm indigenous to the deserts of Leir III. The largest animal on the planet, in rare cases they can grow over 300 meters long. Valakkar are born from clutches of two to three eggs that are laid in shallow nests in the desert. When the young emerge, they burrow into the sand, where they spend the majority of their lives. They move with the aid of overlapping plates that grip the ground, pushing them along without the need for limbs. As omnivores, they subsist on a mixed diet of vegetation, detritus, and meat, and have evolved to need very little water to survive. They are known to attack settlements, preventing the construction of permanent habitation on Leir III.\n",
    "Valkyrie": "The Valkyrie is a dropship spacecraft manufactured by Anvil Aerospace. Designed to carry personnel in and out of combat zones, it features twenty jump seats and gun racks, and is outfitted with manual turrets, remotely operated turrets, side-door guns, and front-mounted guns. Its vehicle bay is capable of carrying multiple ground-based transports that can be launched from its ramp as needed in battle. Used exclusively by the military after it was first made in 2812, Anvil debuted a civilian version of the Valkyrie in 2948.\n",
    "Vanduul": "The Vanduul are hostile beings capable of space flight, quantum travel, and jump point navigation. Humans first made contact with the Vanduul after a clan raided Dell Township on Armitage (Orion III), killing all the settlers but one. Every subsequent encounter with the Vanduul has resulted in mass deaths. The location of their homeworld is unknown. As a culture, the Vanduul seem to lack a central government or command structure; each clan operates as a self-governing entity. All attempts at the establishment of diplomatic connections between Humans and Vanduul have failed.\n",
    "Vanduul Clans": "Vanduul Clans are groups of Vanduul who have banded together to form a single mutually-beneficial unit. Although observers have not yet fully defined the leadership structure, it is believed that Clans operate as a martial meritocracy that shares some similarities with a military unit. The primary goal for most Clans encountered in Human-settled space seems to be the collection of resources through raids on settlements and other Clans. Uncommonly powerful clans may possess a capital-class vessel such as the UEE designated \u201cKingship.\u201d\n",
    "Vanduul Kingship": "Kingship is a military designation for Vanduul capital ships that serve as the apparent flagships of some especially numerous Vanduul clans. The Kingship is the largest type of Vanduul capital asset encountered and is the most powerful class of known warship. Functionally, a Kingship is a dreadnought, fleet carrier, command and control ship and assault transport combined in a single hull. They are very rarely seen, and have only been observed during large-scale Vanduul raids consisting of multiple allied clans. When present, they operate with a large number of other craft, including ships of the line, support vessels and screens of skirmishers. Xeno-anthropologists believe that the possession of a Kingship is a powerful symbol in Vanduul martial culture, signifying a Clan\u2019s power and strength.\n",
    "Vanduul Territory": "Known Vanduul territory consists of 16 planetary systems, with jump point connections to multiple points in the United Empire of Earth (UEE). The Caliban, Orion, Tiber, and Virgil systems were formerly controlled by the UEE, but were lost to the Vanduul after massed invasions. No permanent Vanduul settlements have been observed on any planet in Vanduul Territory. It is theorized that the Vanduul use celestial bodies purely for resource gathering. Newly discovered systems that have a significant Vanduul presence are given a military designation VS and a code name starting with the letter \u201cV\u201d such as the Vanguard system and the Voodoo system.\n",
    "Vanduul-Human First Contact": "On 9 August 2681, a Vanduul raiding party invaded Armitage (Orion III), destroying the Human settlement of Dell Township. All 638 people were killed, save one. United Empire of Earth (UEE) authorities initially believed that outlaws were responsible for the attack. It wasn't until 15 September 2681 that the UEE military encountered their first Vanduul Clan. Because the Vanduul do not operate under a unified government, the UEE was both unable to directly retaliate or seek to establish diplomatic relations. Relations between the UEE and the Vanduul remain hostile.\n",
    "Vann (Croshaw III)": "Vann (Croshaw III) is an inhabited planet in the Croshaw systemterraformed by the United Empire of Earth (UEE), and is represented by two Senators. Located at the far outer edge of the system'sgreen band, its arctic environment supports a Human population along the planet's equator. Vann's economy, once dependent on mining, is now supported by tourism thanks to a thriving winter sports community and the spectacular nightly aurora, visible from all latitudes. Artists inspired by the aurora have begun to set up studios in the large, long-abandoned buildings once used by the mining industry.\n",
    "Vasli Fragment Stone": "The Vasli Fragment is the only known remnant of a stone stele theorized to have been created on Terra (Terra III) around 43,000 SEY ago. A script that has yet to be deciphered is engraved upon it on one side. It was most likely sculpted by the original inhabitants of Terra, who disappeared under unknown circumstances millennia before Human colonization. In the years since it was discovered in 2832, the fragment has been the focus of debate among archaeologists, linguists, and the scientific community.\nThe Vasli Fragment is a large granodiorite stone bearing an inscription on the face. The stone is dark grey in tint, with yellow crystalline streaks and swirls. The front surface is polished with an archaic script deeply incised upon it. A splash of silver and spots of polished yellow agate coat the left-side of the fragment, obscuring some of the text. The sides of the stone are smoothed from water erosion and show evidence of having been attached to a larger monument at some point, although no other fragments have ever been discovered.\nIn the Summer of 2832, the University of Earth at Australia (UEA) conducted an archaeological expedition to Zaffre Bay near Prime on Terra. The fragment was discovered around 150 km from the city, amid a haul of otherwise unremarkable debris. The leader of the expedition, Dr. Kleina Vasli, identified the markings on the stone as an inscription in an unknown language that she later named Terran A.\nThe fragment was taken to the Quasi Institute for Xenological Studies (QIXS) for analysis. Dr. Vasli and the linguists at QIXS connected the script to markers found at the Quasi ruins. This was the first time substantial writing samples had been discovered from the civilization that once inhabited Terra (nicknamed \"Atlanteans\" in popular culture). Over the next two years, linguists attempted to decipher the script but were unable to crack it.\nIn 2834, Dr. Vasli brought the fragment back with her to the UEA for further study. This decision was lambasted by the Terran academic community; many Terrans felt that the stone should remain where it was discovered. Upon Dr. Vasli\u2019s retirement in 2859, the UEA donated the stone to the Museum of Earth (MOE). It remained on display there for 75 years while the Terran government continually submitted requests for its repatriation.\nThe Vasli Fragment was finally returned in 2934. To commemorate this event, the Puglisi Collection commissioned Dr. Amelia Kesh, head chair of the Prime Linguistics Institute, and master sculptor Shinji Torusa to construct an exact copy of the Fragment. Replicas were made available for public sale in 2945.\nWhile the purpose of the Vasli Fragment is still unclear, it has been adopted by several movements in popular culture: Terran separatists use it as a symbol of their desire to break away from the United Empire of Earth, while Transitionalists tout the fragment as evidence that Humanity has many more things left to discover. Fringe groups also claim that the Vasli Fragment details the so-called Atlantean\u2019s conscious decision to leave Terra and influence the growth of all known civilizations. As the Fragment has yet to be translated, their claim is spurious at best.\n",
    "Vatra (Pyro 5b)": "Vatra is the second moon from the gas giant Pyro V, Pyro system. Its thick, high-pressure atmosphere of nitrogen and methane supports an ecosystem of plants that subsist on hydrocarbons instead of carbon dioxide. Some water is present on Vatra in the form of ice, but it is too cold on the surface for it to exist in a liquid state. Travelers who have harvested this ice in emergency situations report that, when melted, it is extremely bitter.\n",
    "Vector System (VS-1)": "The Vector system (designated VS-1 by the United Empire of Earth) is a Vanduul-controlled planetary system that shares jump points with the Tiber and Kellog systems. In the final days of the Siege of Tiber, an enormous Vanduul clan in possession of a Kingship entered the system through the Vector jump point and ultimately defeated the entrenched UEE forces, ending four years of fighting. While exact details of the system\u2019s makeup are classified, it is likely that it harbors one or more planets capable of supporting life.\n",
    "Vega 2a": "Vega 2a is a moon of Aremis (Vega II), United Empire of Earth (UEE). Its icy surface, remarkably smooth in some locations, is bright white and highly reflective. Jets of frozen water containing silica and salts that blast from the moon's many cryovolcanoes sometimes escape orbit and become part of Aremis' rings. The rest of the water turns into snow and falls to cover the surface.\n",
    "Vega 2b": "Vega 2b is the outermost moon of Aremis (Vega II), United Empire of Earth (UEE). A shepherd moon, it closely orbits the outer edge of Aremis' system of rings, clearing out stray debris in orbit around the planet which gives the rings a sharply defined edge. It is believed that the moon is a captured asteroid with possible origins in the Vega belt alpha.\n",
    "Vega Belt Alpha": "The Vega belt alpha is a dense asteroid belt that orbits the star of the Vega system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Because of its location near the orbit of Selene (Vega III), it is a popular location for aspiring miners to stake out their first claim and harvest resources. Permanent installations are less common, however, due to Vanduul raids.\n",
    "Vega I": "Vega I is a dwarf planet that orbits closely to the star of the Vega system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Small and very hot with temperatures that often exceed 200 C, Vega I is inhospitable to known forms of life. Its silicate crust covers a solid iron core, making the planet very dense in spite of its small size. Evidence suggests that a lava ocean once fully covered Vega I.\n",
    "Vega IV": "Vega IV is the fourth planet from the sun in the Vega system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). A gas giant, it has an reddish-brown outer atmosphere made up of hydrogen that is dotted with enormous clouds. Many independently-owned fuel refineries and refueling stations orbit Vega IV for easy access to its resources.\n",
    "Vega System": "The Vega system is a planetary system in the United Empire of Earth (UEE). It consists of one mesoplanet, two terrestrial planets, one gas giant, one asteroid belt, and a G-type main sequence star. It was discovered in 2402 and colonized only seven years later, owing to the presence of two planets that needed only minimal terraformation to be habitable. Selene (Vega III) is recognized by the UEE, holding one seat in the Senate. Aremis (Vega II) was recognized by the UEE on 10 November 2945, in the aftermath of the Battle of Vega II.\nAs one of the UEE star systems bordering Vanduul territory, Vega is under heavy patrol by the UEE military.\nThe system's star, Vega, is a G-Type main sequence star roughly 6.6 billion years old and about 80% the size of Sol. The closest planetary body to it is the mesoplanet Vega I, a hot and desolate rock with a silicate crust. Aremis (Vega II) and Selene (Vega III) are rocky planets terraformed to support Human life. An asteroid belt with an active mining population sits between Selene and Vega IV, a reddish-brown gas giant orbited by refineries.\nVega was discovered during the Human Colonial Expansion Era (2380 - 2530), thanks to the United Nations of Earth (UNE) Eastern Expansion Program. On 02 June 2402, surveyor Barbara Nagasaki found an anomaly in the Oberon system that suggested the presence of a jump point. After conferring with her son Marcus and her sister Vicki, who had accompanied her on this mission, the family decided to bring their ship closer to the anomaly to scan for its signature. Moments after they launched the scan, they accidentally triggered the jump, and the ship was pulled into interspace. Thanks to Marcus' experience in navigation and Vicki's quick piloting reflexes, they regained control of the ship and safely guided it to a new planetary system. Once the Nagasakis completed a survey of the new system, they safely traveled through the jump point a second time, journeyed to Earth (Sol III), and reported their findings to the UNEEEP.\nLocated in the green band, the planets Vega II and Vega III were lightly terraformed and opened for settlement in 2409. The population rapidly increased after 2412, when Alaine Viktus found the Virgil-Vega jump point in the Vega system. This discovery kicked off Project Far Star (2412 - 2681), a program that provided funding to navjumpers and terraforming companies in an effort to expand the borders of the UNE outward from the Virgil system. As expansion continued, Vega became a crossroads between such systems as Orion, Tiber, Bremen, and Terra. Vega II was largely settled by the military, while Vega III rose as a center for commerce and culture, receiving its recognition from the UEE Senate as Selene in 2573. It seemed that the Vega system was well on its way to becoming one of the most influential in the UEE.\nIn 2712, however, its fortunes shifted. The Orion system, only three jumps away from Vega, was suddenly and unexpectedly lost to the Vanduul. Population growth stalled. Sprawling construction projects built ahead of a projected population increase were abandoned, and the economy entered a recession. In 2736 and 2737, Selene's situation became even more dire when the Vanduul wrenched the Tiber and Virgil systems from the grasp of the UEE, putting Vega directly on the border of Vanduul territory. Refugees from Virgil chose to resettle on Vega II instead of Selene, due to its strong military presence. Experts believed that Vega would be the Vanduul's next target. Once one of the fastest-growing systems in the UEE, Vega's population growth entered the negatives.\nIn the mid 2800s, Vega II broke this pattern. Initially drawn by the cheap and available real estate, people from outside the system began to purchase homes and settle there. Then, in 2884, the Vanduul invaded the Caliban system instead of moving on Vega as had been predicted. The prevailing sense of danger in the system eased, especially on Vega II, under the direct protection of the military. By the early 2940s, it became more populous and prosperous than Selene, and the planet made a bid for Senate recognition.\nThe feared Vanduul invasion finally arrived in 2945, when a large Clan accompanied by a rarely-sighted Kingship entered the system and launched a direct attack on Vega II. The UEE Navy's 2nd Fleet, commanded by Admiral Ernst Bishop, had been tracking scouts of this Clan and was in the area when the attack was launched. After a lengthy battle, the vastly outnumbered UEEN forces managed to destroy the Kingship and drive the Vanduul out of the system. The effects on Vega II were devastating; entire cities were wiped out and the death toll was in the millions.\nIn the aftermath of the attack, Imperator Costigan and the UEE Senate officially recognized Vega II as Aremis and Edward Aemile as its first senator. Buildings damaged in the Battle of Vega II have since been restored or replaced.\nVega is known throughout the UEE for its food. Selene's low cost of living and available land supports an urban farming movement in most of the planet's cities. In Titus, the planet's most populous city, there is a rising number of farm-to-table restaurants supported by city-grown fruits and vegetables. The nature of the food served changes depending on the time of year and what can be grown in each locale. On Aremis, the food culture is centered around molecular gastronomy. Elaborate meals based on experimental techniques are commonplace in New Corvo.\nBecause it is located on the border of Vanduul territory, the threat of Vanduul invasion never fully leaves the consciousness of the people of Vega. Absurdist art, reflective of existential dread and the folly of war, is popular on Selene. There is also an artistic movement towards returning to nature. Bizarre pieces that express irrationality and degradation of form can be found in local galleries as easily as a sculpture made entirely from reclaimed or organic materials. Aremis, home to many descendants of refugees from Orion, Tiber, Caliban, and Virgil, offers a contrasting picture; the art there is decadent, sensuous, and experimental.\n",
    "Verified Offworld Laser Technologies (VOLT)": "Verified Offworld Laser Technologies (VOLT) is a Human manufacturer of energy weapons. The company specializes in producing handheld and ship weapons based on existing and proven technology rather than investing in an internal research department to innovate, like many of their competitors. This has allowed them to offer their products at below market rates and makes them a popular choice among purchasers who are cost conscious. These lower prices may also be indicative of lower quality manufacturing technique, as the company has frequently been plagued with reliability complaints. However, a formal investigation into their products in 2939 did not reveal a higher than average rate of failure. The VOLT lineup includes weapons such as the Zenith sniper rifle, Prism shotgun, Pulse energy pistol, and Stinger repeating laser.\n",
    "VFG Industrial": "VFG Industrial is a spacecraft hangar manufacturer that produces personal hangars designed for extreme environments.

The VFG Industrial team maintains a unit of zero gravity workers and invests heavily in advanced excavation equipment.\n",
    "Vid": "Vid is a term for any moving audiovisual media recorded via an electronic medium, such as content that is produced for and broadcast over Spectrum. Feature-length films, serial broadcasts, limited series, documentaries, and other types of audiovisual media all fall under the umbrella of vids. The term derives from the Latin video \u201cI see.\u201d\n",

Vidpro also writes its own reviews.\n",
    "Vili (Odin 2a)": "Vili (Odin 2a) is the moon of Odin II, Odin system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Cold and snowy, the largest settlement on Vili is Raleigh Station, a former base of operations for a now-defunct weapons testing company. The station now serves as a waypoint for civilian contractors to bring in supplies and ferry out hazardous materials from Odin II.\n",
    "Vindel": "The vindel is a detritivorous fish indigenous to the shallow freshwater river and ponds of Locke (Idris IV), United Empire of Earth (UEE). Like other detritivorous animals, it feeds on the waste and dead material that collects at the bottom of bodies of water. The tentacles on its head aid the vindel in digging through the substrate to find food. Because of its small size and the voracity of its appetite, the vindel is favored by aquarium enthusiasts to control algae blooms and consume the waste of other fish.\nA vindel can be identified by its distinctive mottled green scaleless skin and the six tentacles that sprout from the front of its flattened head. Instead of eyes, vindels have two false eye spots on their backs, which are used to deceive potential predators. The false eyes double as electroreceptors that alert the vindel if a potential predator gets too close. They have four triangular, blue-green pectoral fins, a long, thin dorsal fin, and blue-green tail fins. Over a 20 year life cycle, the vindel grows no more than 25 cm long.\nOn Locke, vindels exist in every climate except the arctic. They are highly adaptive, capable of breathing in very murky water, and have even been found in brackish water near the mouths of rivers. Water that has been purchased on or harvested from Locke must be thoroughly inspected for vindels before it is taken off world. Vindels that have made it into the water supply of spacecraft have been known to survive there for up to two standard weeks before starving.\nIn the wild, vindels spawn in the spring and summer, or when the water that they inhabit reaches a temperature of between 21 and 29 degrees Celsius. When they are ready to spawn, the male locates a nesting area such as between rocks, in the roots of plants, undercuts of banks, or other areas in which the eggs can be protected from strong currents. After the female lays her eggs, the male fertilizes them and drives the female from the nest. He then guards the eggs, chasing off predators and fanning them with his fins to keep them free of excessive sediment. The eggs hatch after roughly 12 standard Earth days. After all the eggs have hatched, the male leaves, and the fry disperse. Vindels can spawn every three standard weeks.\nThe fry that are not eaten by predators or otherwise killed reach maturity in about one Standard Earth Year. They generally do not breed until they have reached at least 15 cm in length.\nThanks to its hearty constitution and appetite for algae, the vindel has become a popular aquarium fish since its discovery in 2494 by United Nations of Earth (UNE) surveyors. A vindel needs little supplementary feeding unless it is the only fish in its tank, and can survive in a wide range of temperatures. However, these attributes have also made it an invasive species in many parts of the UEE. It was so successful in taking root on Reisse (Rhetor III) that it caused the extinction of 11 other indigenous detritivores before the Governors Council was able to enact measures to get it under control. Fish enthusiasts who have released their vindels into the wild are subject to hefty fines.\n",

    "Vosca (Elysium III)": "Vosca is the third planet from the sun of the Elysium system, United Empire of Earth (UEE), and is home to a small population of Humans and Tevarin. Largely covered with an arid desert, water is scarce on the surface of Vosca, except near the north and south poles. To cope with persistent drought conditions, water farms are common. Some mobile operations travel across the landscape just ahead of the solar terminator, staying on the planet's cooler nighttime side to increase their output. Many settlements, such as the arcology Reza's Landing, are constructed under protective domes due to persistent, violent sandstorms.\n",
    "Voyager Direct": "Voyager Direct is a general marketplace for goods that is widely utilized in the United Empire of Earth (UEE). Founded by former-hauler Cary Lindle in 2898, the company does not have its own line of products but rather acts as a third party storefront for sellers who wish to offer their goods to a wider range of people. In addition to having storefronts throughout the UEE, Voyager Direct offers its customers a popular Spectrum-based shopping service where they can remotely order various products. In 2936, the company was accused of illegal price-fixing by the Trade and Development Division of the UEE. The matter was settled out of court.\n",
    "Vulcan": "The Vulcan is a refuel, rearm and repair spacecraft manufactured by Aegis Dynamics for the United Empire of Earth (UEE) military. First launched in 2594, it was commissioned by the UEE Navy after they requested proposals for a medium-sized support spacecraft. After a successful trial period, the UEEN promoted the ship into active service as its standard front-line support ship during such conflicts as the Second Tevarin War (2603 - 2610) and the Siege of Tiber (2732 - 2736). Since its introduction, it has been upgraded many times, and civilian models of the Vulcan have been offered to the public since the early 27th century.\n",
    "Vulture": "The Vulture is a single-pilot salvage spacecraft manufactured by Drake Interplanetary and first released in 2938. It was designed for long-term solo operations in unclaimed or otherwise dangerous locations. Each Vulture is built with a cargo bay for the storage of harvested materials, along with scraper beams for efficient salvage and an industrial-grade tractor rig.\n",
    "Vuur (Pyro 5f)": "Vuur is the sixth moon from the gas giant Pyro V, Pyro system. Thanks to an increased greenhouse effect in its dense carbon dioxide atmosphere, it is unusually warm for a moon so distant from its sun. Its carbon-rich soil supports forms of vegetation that utilize crystalline carbon in their base structures. Before the system was overtaken by outlaws in the early 27th century, these plants were a popular subject of research among botanists.\n",
    "Wala (Stanton 3b)": "Wala is the second-closest moon of ArcCorp (Stanton III). Naturally-formed veins of blue-green crystal jutting from the moon's surface are visible from orbit. ArcCorp operates a number of surface mining facilities on Wala. Although the thin atmosphere and bitter cold make life on Wala challenging, organizations in search of lighter business restrictions than those on ArcCorp have established themselves there.\n",
    "Walleye (Ellis IX)": "Walleye (Ellis IX) is a large gas giant in the Ellis system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Primarily used as a refueling world for passing freighters and warships, the skyline is dotted by refineries that keep fuel in steady supply. The planet's nickname comes from the strange storms that occur deep within the planet's atmosphere that cause white spots to appear. These spots are said to resemble the eyeshine of the walleye fish, an animal found on Earth (Sol III).\n",
    "Warden": "The Vanguard Warden is a deep space fighter created by Aegis Dynamics for the United Empire of Earth Navy (UEEN). Its base model is a twin-engine, multi-crew ship designed to perform long duration missions that would otherwise be outside the reach of shorter-range fighters. Though it is less maneuverable than other Navy spacecraft like the Hornet, it is capable of taking more damage and carrying more munitions. Other variants of the Vanguard include the Harbinger fighter-bomber, the Sentinel electronic warfare platform and the Hoplite dropship.\n",
    "Warlock": "The Warlock is a variant of the Avenger patrol ship developed by Aegis Dynamics. The Warlock replaces the rear living space of the standard model with an electro-magnetic pulse (EMP) generator. The United Empire of Earth Navy (UEEN) and Advocacy both use Avenger Warlocks for battlefield support and non-lethal apprehension missions; Aegis also makes a limited number of Warlocks available on the civilian market.\n",
    "Warlord Corath'thal": "Corath'thal was a Tevarin Warlord who led an armed insurgency against the United Empire of Earth (UEE) during the Second Tevarin War (2603 - 2610). A brilliant and charismatic leader, he unified many Tevarin that had been scattered in the First Tevarin War (2541 - 2546) in order to reclaim their homeworld Kaleeth (Jalan/Elysium IV) from the UEE. Corath'thal utilized guerilla tactics to quietly move through systems and attack where the UEE military wasn't. This approach proved to be devastating against the UEE, who struggled to anticipate where Corath'thal would attack next. However, as the war dragged on, the Tevarin forces fell in number and could not be replenished. When it became clear after the Battle of Centauri that the Tevarin would once again lose against the Humans, Corath'thal and his fleet engaged in a final push to Kaleeth, where they lowered their ships' shielding and burned up in the planet's atmosphere.\n",
    "Whitley's Guide": "Whitley\u2019s Guide is a consumer-centric magazine released by Gallivan Publishing that features in-depth analysis and reviews of spacecraft, vehicles, and related items. Created by Sal Whitley and Darby Keilich, it was first published in 2856 and has been in continuous print since. Editors of Whitley\u2019s Guide require their reviewers to write as objectively as possible about the products that they test. In 2950, the magazine partnered with Terra Spectrum Broadcasting to launch a show by the same name, hosted by Jax McCleary. Although McCleary\u2019s enthusiastic style is a departure from the serious tone of the print magazine, his popularity with spacecraft enthusiasts made him the network's first and only choice as host.\n",
    "WillsOp": "WillsOp is a Human limited liability corporation that produces targeting system hardware and software used in spacecraft. Established in 2902, they saw limited market success until a 2922 computer virus infected the firmware updates of many major ship manufacturers. This virus locked shipboard sensor suites to greyscale mode, making them nearly unusable. Due to a difference in coding systems, the virus failed to infect WillsOp-made sensor operating systems. Many security-minded companies opened contracts with WillsOp and increased the company\u2019s stake in the market. They currently have a contract with the United Empire of Earth (UEE) military and Anvil Aerospace to manufacture the radar system installed in F7A-R Hornets and by Origin Jumpworks to install a custom targeting system for the 325a.\n",
    "Wintle Design Company": "The Wintle Design Company is a Human manufacturer of luxury craft goods, located in Prime on Terra (Terra III). Since its founding in 2895, the company has remained committed to using only master craftspeople and their apprentices to create artisanal furniture, home goods, spacecraft interiors, and other high-end items. In 2941, Roberts Space Industries (RSI) partnered with the Wintle Design Company to equip the master suite of the Constellation Phoenix.\n",
    "Worldmaker": "Worldmaker was a Human terraforming company. Founded in the mid-22nd century during the first terraforming boom, the company initially focused on perfecting terraforming technologies and ultimately engaged in large-scale planetary development. By the start of the 25th century, Worldmaker had acquired much of its own competition and had become the third largest terraforming conglomerate in the United Nations of Earth (UNE). In 2480, Shubin Interstellar acquired a controlling interest in Worldmaker, until they eventually merged the company into itself.\n",
    "X1": "The X1 is an open-canopy snub spacecraft manufactured by Origin Jumpworks and designed by famed ship engineer Alberto Vara and his company Infinity Custom. Constructed with specialized polymers to keep it light, the X1 is a luxury single-seater built for speed and agility. It can be utilized for light combat on the ground and in space, but doesn\u2019t come with a quantum drive or jump engine. The joint vector thruster placement and integrated engine technology help achieve its sleek overall profile.\n",
    "X1 Force": "The X1 Force is a variant of the X1 ultralight spacecraft developed by Origin Jumpworks and two-time Aron Award winner ship engineer Alberto Vara\u2019s design company, Infinity Custom. The redesign upgrades weaponry and armor in exchange for a slight reduction in speed and handling. The most significant changes are the addition of a second shield generator and the switch from an M3A Laser Cannon to a CF-117 Bulldog Laser Repeater. Produced in smaller numbers than the other X1 models, Origin has marketed it to anyone interested in fast combat, ground interception, and infiltration missions.\n",
    "X1 Velocity": "The X1 Velocity is a variant of the X1 ultralight spacecraft developed by Origin Jumpworks and two-time Aron Award-winning ship engineer Alberto Vara\u2019s design company, Infinity Custom. As the name implies, the Velocity focuses primarily on improved speed and handling over the base X1. To that end, Origin engineers abandoned all the attached weaponry and converted the majority of the standard hull material into Syntek composites. The process ultimately removed eight percent of the original model\u2019s total weight, creating a variant popular among open canopy racers.\n",
    "Xenia": "Xenia is a Human-constructed space station in the Baker system that serves as a shipping hub for the Covalex corporation. It was built to support trade between the United Empire of Earth (UEE) and the Xi'an Empire. Its habitation facilities and pressurized hangar bays provide support for spacecraft crews making long haul cargo runs.\n",
    "Xenoanthropology": "Xenoanthropology is the scientific study of alien behavior, cultures, and societies. There are many branches of xenoanthropology, including linguistic, biological, social, and cultural. There is an ongoing debate in the field over the value of observational versus total immersion studies. Degrees in the discipline began to be offered at Human universities in the 2440s, after Banu-Human First Contact in 2438.\n",
    "Xenoarchaeology": "Xenoarchaeology is the study of alien culture and history through the excavation of ancient sites and the analysis of physical materials. A Human xenoarchaeologist, for example, may specialize in Hadesian artifacts, whereas a Xi\u2019an xenoarchaeologist may be an expert in excavating ancient Human pottery. Xenoarchaeology is mainly concerned with recovering knowledge of prehistory, especially of extinct alien civilizations. It draws upon multiple disciplines and requires years of study, mentorship, and practice.\n",
    "XenoThreat": "XenoThreat is a Human outlaw group based in the Pyro system that is known for a violently anti-alien and anti-corporate ideology. Law enforcement believes that the group is primarily formed by corrupt ex-members of the United Empire of Earth (UEE) military. Most of its criminal activity was concentrated in the Pyro system until 2949, when systems connected to Pyro such as Stanton and Terra began to report on raids led by members of XenoThreat. In 2951, XenoThreat launched an organized raid into the Stanton system that was eventually repelled by a combination of Navy, Advocacy, and CDF forces.\n",
    "Xi'an": "The Xi\u2019an are a spacefaring civilization indigenous to the planet RyiXy\u2019an (Hyoton III). They are capable of space flight, quantum travel, jump point navigation, and planetary terraformation. Their leader, Emperor Kr.\u0113, has reigned over the Xi\u2019an Empire (SaoXy\u2019an) since SEY 2643 (III.926).\nHumans first made contact with the Xi\u2019an in the Xi\u2019an-controlled Th.us\u2019\u016bng system in SEY 2530 (III.838), when Human-owned Gaia Planet Services attempted to start terraforming operations on Th.us\u2019\u016bng III, having done so without approval from the Human government and without having surveyed the planet to learn that it was already inhabited. After first contact, the Xi\u2019an and Human governments entered into a period of sustained conflict known as the Xi\u2019an-Human Cold War (SEY 2530 - 2793; III.838 - III.1044). Military buildup on both sides resulted in the creation of the Perry Line in SEY 2542 (III.847) as a buffer between the two factions. At its height, the Perry Line consisted of eight planetary systems with jump points connecting Xi\u2019an and Human territories. At the end of the Cold War, the Perry Line systems were demilitarized, divided, and annexed into the United Empire of Earth (UEE) and the Xi\u2019an Empire. The end of the Cold War has brought warmer relations between the Human and Xi\u2019an governments.\n",
    "Xi'an Calendar": "The Xi\u2019an calendar (Modern Xi\u2019an Year, r.aiXy\u2019an) is measured by the celestial mechanics of their former homeworld, RyiXy\u2019an (Hyoton III). It differs from the Human calendar in a number of significant ways; for example, each Xi\u2019an year is equivalent to 1.28 Human years, is assigned a number counting upwards from when the current Imperial House ascended to the throne, and is prepended with a number that represents the corresponding Imperial Age. The First Imperial Age began in the Human year 19668 BCE, and was recorded by the Xi\u2019an as I.0 (or 1.0) The current Third Imperial Age began in the Human year 1457, and was recorded by the Xi\u2019an as as III.0 (or 3.0).\n",
    "Xi'an Clothing": "Xi\u2019an clothing is typically made of long-lasting materials, and is passed down the family line for use by younger generations. Even mass-produced clothing is made to last for centuries. Wealthier Houses possess custom livery worn only by members of the family. However, those in the Xi\u2019an Youth Counterculture movement have embraced a Human-inspired trend of disposable garments. The Xi\u2019an clothing industry is managed by House Tu\u0113l and its satellite Houses.\n",
    "Xi'an Cuisine": "Xi\u2019an cuisine is the traditional method by which Xi\u2019an prepare their food for consumption. Rather than using heat to alter the nutrient bioavailability of ingredients as is traditionally done by Humans, Xi\u2019an utilize aging and fermentation. Xi\u2019an cannot digest the majority of fresh fare and are intolerant of hot or cold meals. Level of aging, type of fermentation, strength of flavor, and texture are the most important aspects of Xi\u2019an food preparation. Humans consider Xi\u2019an food to be harshly flavored.\nThe first indications of cultivated Xi\u2019an cuisine arose when Xi\u2019an established permanent homesteads. Before this time, they traveled in nomadic family groups, scouring the landscape for sustenance while protecting one another from predators. The hot, humid environment of their homeworld was conducive to rapid decay of potential food sources. Food with rich microbiomes such as carrion and rotted leaves made up the bulk of the early Xi\u2019an diet. Predators kept them on the move. It wasn\u2019t until agriculture and animal husbandry were discovered that families were able to create long-term settlements fortified against natural predators, allowing them time and space to experiment with meal preparation techniques.\nMajor characteristics of contemporary Xi\u2019an cuisine soon emerged. Bacteria, molds, yeasts, and spices that enhanced food with intense textural sensations and robust flavors were sought after and cultivated. Aged eggs collected from abandoned s.\u0101oth nests became so popular that the lizard was domesticated. Meat harvested from animals allowed to die of natural causes became famous among prosperous families for being more tender and flavorful than meat from slaughtered animals; this attitude persists among Xi\u2019an chefs today. Meat that was heavily spiced, left to age in the sun until soft and pungent, and served alongside strips of the leafy vegetable nga.u\u2019ii\u2019y\u0113l became a favorite dish.\nThe discovery of fermentation revolutionized the Xi\u2019an diet. Plants they couldn\u2019t previously digest, such as grain pai'pun and legume pai\u2019lio, became staples of their new diet. Vessels used for fermentation doubled as long-term food stores, allowing families to stockpile their resources and expand beyond homesteads into state-like powers called Houses. Demand for spice and other food additives opened trade routes between distant locations. As Houses continued to grow, so did the Xi\u2019an palate.\nEvery Xi\u2019an dish is constructed to balance texture with intensity of flavor. 13 favorable tastes, 13 favorable textures, and 13 unfavorable qualities were identified by members of House Uai\u2019i in their treatise Three Leaves of Flavor. These were compiled into a text and sold to traders en route to other Houses. The treatise was hugely influential to Xi\u2019an cuisine as an art. Even today, the ideal y.iy\u2019atin\u2019tang (multitextured) meal described in the treatise remains the end goal for Xi\u2019an chefs.\nFermentation is the foundation of the Xi\u2019an diet. Ingredients are typically cut into large pieces, then seasoned and placed inside a tyixa\u2019yetui (fermentation vessel). The vessel is then placed inside the nyuntui (fermentation chamber), a temperature-controlled room with deeply grooved walls inoculated with colonies of yeast, mold, and bacteria. These tya e Yii\u2019ua (House strains), unique to each House and closely guarded, are cultivated over generations. At first, the vessels are left open to invite the strains into the process. The vessels are then sealed, usually for months, before being opened again, cut into bite-sized pieces, placed on large dishes, and served alongside other meals, most often at room temperature (30 C).\nFood that isn\u2019t fermented is aged via air-curing, sun-ripening, drying, controlled rot, the addition of micro-organisms, or other methods. If a dish has been prepared well, a Xi\u2019an might say that it is \u201cproperly rotted.\u201d A bland dish might be described as \u201clacking rot.\u201d This applies to beverages as well. One popular drink, chui.y\u2019o\u2019sui, is made from the aged blood of various animals and mixed with complimentary vinegars. Even purified water would be considered unpalatable to Xi\u2019an; on Xi\u2019an worlds, drinking water is enhanced with minerals and various micro-organisms for health and flavor.\nXi\u2019an eat only a few times per week. Shared meals are considered a big family affair. Even Xi\u2019an who are traveling alone will choose to share tables with strangers at restaurants. At the center of a communal table filled with various dishes one can always find a thauil (condiments platter) loaded with seasonings and dressings that will impart various favorable flavors on one\u2019s food, such as ki.s\u2019a (ammoniac; chemical; bitter), ngi\u2019pi (itching; buzzing; pain), or p.\u016bnt.a (alcoholic, warming). Xi\u2019an do not experience intoxication from consuming alcohol, and some more forward-leaning Xi\u2019an restaurateurs on Oya III have added Human-influenced alcoholic seasonings to their menus.\nSince the thawing of tensions between the United Empire of Earth and the Xi\u2019an Empire (SaoXy'an), Xi\u2019an have begun to explore Human styles of cooking. Dishes such as shiokara, blue cheeses, and lutefisk have been unreservedly embraced by Xi\u2019an chefs. Cold-brewed pu-erh tea has made waves due to its similarity to hai\u2019pe, a beverage steeped in sunlight from the leaves of a tropical pine tree. The beverage rotik is similarly popular among adventurously-minded Xi\u2019an. This is especially notable because nginguichui (milky; creamy; like animal milk) has been considered an unfavorable food quality for hundreds of millennia. However, hot and cold food, also ill-regarded in the Xi\u2019an tradition, seems unlikely to catch on.\n",
    "Xi'an Empire (SaoXy\u2019an)": "The Xi'an Empire (SaoXy'an) is a multi-system government headed by the Xi\u2019an Emperor and inhabited by the Xi'an. Its capital system, Hyoton, is the location of the former Xi'an homeworld RyiXy'an (Hyoton III) and Ka'ua (Hyoton IV), the current home of the Emperor. It is made up of thirteen known planetary systems. Human political experts believe that there might be more systems that the Xi'an haven't divulged to other civilizations. The Xi'an Empire borders the United Empire of Earth along a series of planetary systems formerly known as the Perry Line. It also shares a border with Kr\u2019thak territory, though the exact coordinates of this border are not known.\n",
    "Xi'an Government": "The Xi\u2019an government is an absolute monarchy, headed by an Emperor and supported by a High Council of three advisers. The advisors are responsible for maintaining the Xi\u2019an Service (P\u014d\u2019t.\u014dngp.\u016b), each branch of which is overseen by another Council of Three. Below the family of the Emperor are the Houses: state-corporations run by and made up of vast, interconnected families. Each House oversees a single aspect of society or production, approved of or dictated by the Emperor. The current Emperor, the last heir of the House of Kr.\u0113, has reigned since 2643.\n",
    "Xi'an House (Yii'ua)": "A Xi\u2019an House (Yii\u2019ua), or Line is a complex social and familial body in the Xi\u2019an Empire (SaoXy\u2019an) made up of members of a single family. Houses serve the functions of states and corporations within the framework of the Xi\u2019an government. Each House is allowed by the Emperor to serve one function deemed vital to the mutual prosperity of the Xi\u2019an Empire.\n",
    "Xi'an Language (uo'aXy\u2019an)": "The Xi\u2019an Language (uo'aXy\u2019an) is a group of languages spoken by the Xi\u2019an. It refers to the standard dialect, the military dialect, and countless other dialects dispersed throughout the Xi\u2019an Empire. Most Xi\u2019an dialects are mutually intelligible due to the re-organization of Xi\u2019an culture after the end of the Great Divide (20044 - 19770 BCE) and the requirement for all Xi\u2019an to spend 30 years in the Xi\u2019an Service (P\u014d\u2019t.\u014dngp.\u016b). The same standardized writing system is used across all Xi\u2019an dialects.\n",
    "Xi'an Terraforming": "Xi\u2019an terraforming practice is unique among known sentient civilizations. Rather than only creating a biome to sustain life, Xi\u2019an terraform planets to fit functions seen as necessary to the well-being of Xi\u2019an society. Some functions include manufacturing, nature preservation, and religious centers.\nThe Xi\u2019an discovered terraforming roughly 6000 SEY before the beginning of the First Imperial Age (about 25400 BCE), when a series of volcanic eruptions forced the then-divided Houses to pool their resources to push back against the rapid cooling of their home planet. Early geohacking machines, the precursor to platform-based terraformers, stopped the catastrophic global cooling cascade before it could end life on the planet. Today, the Xi\u2019an use the Th.us\u2019\u016bng system as a testbed for advanced terraforming technology.\n",
    "Xi'an Youth Counterculture (Yit\u0113\u2019kuit.i)": "Xi\u2019an youth counterculture (yit\u0113\u2019kuit.i) is a movement made up of young Xi\u2019an, mostly those who have not yet completed their compulsory time with the Xi\u2019an Service (P\u014d\u2019t.\u014dngp.\u016b), who experiment with practices not traditional to Xi\u2019an society. Human culture is particularly appealing to Xi\u2019an youth. The main center of the counterculture movement is located in the former Perry Line system Kyuk\u2019ya, on the Pue\u2019nu (Kyuk\u2019ya 1a) shipping hub thanks to its high level of interspecies trade.\n",
    "Xi'an-Human Cold War": "The Xi'an-Human Cold War (SEY 2530 - 2793) was a period of military and political tension between the United Empire of Earth (UEE) and the Xi'an Empire. It was sparked from first contact between the two civilizations when in 2530 when a Human terraforming company, acting illegally, attempted to set up operations in the Xi'an system Th.us'\u016bng and were captured by the Xi'an who discovered them there. Though there was no large-scale combat between the sides, bordering planetary systems became militarized zones. The cold war formally ended with the signing of the Perry Line Pact in 2793.\n",
    "Xi'an-Human First Contact": "Humans and Xi'an first made contact in SEY 2530 when Gaia Planet Services (GPS), a Human terraforming corporation, attempted to set up operations on the Th.us'\u016bng system. Because GPS had illegally entered the system, they neglected to perform the necessary surveys required by law, and were thus unaware that the system was already occupied before they attempted to terraform one of the planets. This activity nearby attracted Xi'an military forces, who seized control of the facility and GPS personnel. For 57 days, the Xi'an held the Humans hostage while negotiating for information from the United Planets of Earth (UPE). Once the UPE capitulated to the Xi'an Empire's terms, the hostages were released without harm. However, the distrust sown on both sides marked the beginning of the Xi\u2019an-Human Cold War (2530 - 2793).\n",
    "Xiphopod (Blind Oni Crab)": "The Xiphopod is a soft-shelled invertebrate omnivore indigenous to Leir I. Xiphopods, known colloquially as \u201cBlind Oni Crabs,\u201d are typically found on worlds with hot grassland environments, but have also been found to be highly adaptable to extreme conditions. They are considered an invasive species in the United Empire of Earth (UEE). Their ability to float and propel themselves through the air has made them a favorite subject of xenobiologists.\nDiscovered during the initial planetary survey of Leir I, several specimens were captured and delivered to the University of Rhetor for study and classification. The scientists named the new species Xiphopod in honor of its resemblance to animals in the phylum Arthropoda and genus Xiphosura. The surveyors who discovered the animal, inspired by the \u201cface\u201d and \u201cnose\u201d that can be discerned in the animal\u2019s front carapace, were responsible for the more common name \u201cBlind Oni Crab.\u201d\nXiphopods are found naturally on Leir I, in hot to warm grassy climates at or near sea level. In their native environments, they spend their time hunting, scavenging for food, and resting. Xiphopods spend part of their year in groups, then split off and travel hundreds of kilometers to join other groups during mating season. Biologists theorize that this behavior developed in order to ensure genetic diversity among the species.\nTheir unique flight pattern occurs via biological process. The Xiphopod converts surrounding air into a hydrogen-helium mix and circulates it within a large, hollow cavity. This allows it to float. It then propels itself through the air by expelling gas from its body, which is incredibly light compared to its size. The most heavyweight adult Xiphopod ever found weighed only 300 g (10.58 oz).\nThe Xiphopod is a common invasive species, thanks in large part to its opportunistic omnivorous diet, and its ability to adapt to a variety of conditions. Its reproductive habits also play a part: Xiphopods lay up to a thousand eggs at a time. Typically, the unattended eggs hatch in 13-17 Standard Earth Days. The UEE prohibits the trading of Xiphopods in order to discourage their spread throughout habitable space.\nThe hot, dry environment of Hurston (Stanton I) has proven particularly hospitable to Xiphopods. Although it feeds on a variety of food types, it thrives off the biological waste generated from the settlements on Hurston, and has been able to breed in great numbers thanks to the lack of natural predators. While Xiphopod hunting is encouraged by the local government, for the poorest inhabitants of Hurston, the Xiphopod can be a food source. When roasted, the flesh of the Xiphopod becomes white and firm, and the meat has a musty, sweet flavor.\n",
    "Xis (Kellog II)": "Xis (Kellog II) is the second planet from the sun of the Fair Chance Act (FCA)-protected Kellog system. A biologically diverse, lushly vegetated world, it is home to the developing Orm civilization and is protected by UEE Army patrols who enforce the FCA. Deep, multi-canopied rainforests and warm seas cover much of the planet's surface. The Orm largely reside in the temperate forests of the planet's polar regions. In the early 30th century, several freshwater slugs were smuggled off Xis and were sold to collectors under the name \"Flo-Pets,\" which led to a fad that ultimately turned the animals into an invasive species on multiple worlds throughout the United Empire of Earth (UEE).\n",
    "Xi\u2019an Criminal Professionals (Nyayu\u2019a)": "Xi\u2019an criminal professionals (nyayu\u2019a) are Xi\u2019an who are granted license by the Xi\u2019an government to practice certain forms of crime. Similar to Human crime syndicates, these Xi\u2019an Houses double as disciplined organizations whose business involves criminal activity. In return for sanction from the Imperial House, these Houses sometimes act as police forces for their locations, curtailing the activity of potentially dangerous criminals from non-crime Houses and keeping crime at levels considered acceptable by the Xi\u2019an government. Many Xi\u2019an will pay regular protection fees to criminal Houses in advance to limit the extent of their losses if they become victims of crime themselves.\n",
    "Xi\u2019an Service (P\u014d\u2019t.\u014dngp.\u016b)": "The Xi\u2019an Service (P\u014d\u2019t.\u014dngp.\u016b), or Imperial Bureaucracy is a bureaucratic and military body made up of Xi\u2019an aged 40 to 70. The backbone of the reigning Imperial House (Yii\u2019uaTao\u201d), the Service is compulsory for all Xi\u2019an. It was created in the wake of the Xi\u2019an Civil War (20044 - 19770 BCE) as a method to instill an overarching loyalty to the Imperial House and the Xi\u2019an people rather than an individual Xi\u2019an\u2019s personal House of origin. While most return to their own Houses after their Service period ends, some elect to stay in the Service permanently.\n",
    "Xyeping (Ail'ka I)": "Xyeping (Ail'ka I) is the innermost planet in the Ail'ka system, Xi'an Empire (SaoXy'an). A rocky protoplanet, it is likely to have originated from the nearby Ail'ka belt alpha that's located between it and the rest of the planetary system. Xyeping is bombarded with heat and radiation from the enormous B-type main sequence star that sits in the center of the Ail'ka system.\n",
    "Yar (Centauri II)": "Yar is the second planet from the sun in the Centauri system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Located close to the inner boundary of Centauri's green zone, Yar's environment is hot and arid, and sparsely populated. The planet's most visible feature is a vast barren region known as the Red Desert. A variety of research and mining outposts were established on Yar after precious minerals were discovered there in the early 29th century; however, most were abandoned after the larger deposits were depleted in the early 2910s. A scattered population of Humans made up of remaining miners and their descendants remain on Yar.\n",
    "Ye'ten (Ail'ka III)": "Ye'ten (Ail'ka III) is the third planet from the sun of the Ail'ka system, Xi'an Empire (SaoXy'an). Terraformed for the express purpose of agricultural production, Ye\u2019ten is a world in which all available arable land is being used to grow food and other important organic staples, raise livestock, and ferment raw ingredients to supply the rest of the Xi\u2019an Empire. It is estimated that decades of rations are stockpiled there in case of emergency. To reduce the chance of travelers bringing contaminants or invasive species to the planet, the only area open for landing is a sealed and tightly monitored enclosure.\n",
    "Yela (Stanton 2c)": "Yela is the outermost natural satellite of Crusader (Stanton II), and is orbited by a ring of asteroids. A thin crust of water-ice on the moon's surface is said to represent the cool demeanor of Yela, the oldest sibling in the Human children's story A Gift for Baba, after whom the moon was named. Crusader Industries security came under fire during a Senate hearing in SEY 2949 for failing to curtail criminal activity in the outpost colloquially known as Jumptown, located inside one of Yela's craters.\nDue to its thin oxygen atmosphere and distance from the system's sun, the surface of Yela is very cold, with average temperatures ranging between -55 \u00b0C and -10 \u00b0C. The large water ice sheets that sprawl across the plains and mountains feed the water cycle via sublimation. There are no bodies of liquid water on Yela's surface, nor is there any rainfall, but snow showers, fog, and windstorms can arise when the weather conditions are correct.\nDiscovered by navjumper Toshi Aaron alongside the rest of the Stanton system in 2851, Yela was briefly the sole property of the United Empire of Earth (UEE). During this time, the UEE Navy began to construct a base in the skies of Stanton II. It lightly mined the moons for resources, but largely left them alone.\nIn 2865, driven by a financial crisis, the UEE sold all the planets and moons in the system to various corporations, including Crusader Industries, who purchased the parent planet along with Yela and its sister moons. After refitting the Navy's platforms on the newly-renamed planet Crusader for its own use, the company established multiple mining facilities and security outposts across Yela, Cellin (Stanton 2a), and Daymar (Stanton 2b), and offered some of the land for lease.\nIn spite of the inhospitable environment, some Humans have made Yela their home. Wilma Ivery built the first permanent homestead in 2907, where she lived until her death in 2935 from natural causes. In 2909, the first Human was born on Yela when Albert and Nora Triolo were forced to make an emergency landing to give birth to their daughter, Erma Triolo. Outlaw group Nine Tails began using abandoned Navy facilities as bases in 2946, leading to an increase in patrols from Crusader Security.\nUnregulated ground-vehicle racing is a popular pastime among residents of and visitors to Yela. Lakedra Walsh organized and won the first recorded ground-vehicle race on the moon in 2912. The site of this race was made into a permanent racetrack, and was named Lakedra's Lap in her honor. Many of the racing sites take advantage of Yela's terrain, and include large boulders and rocks. In 2917, amateur racer Ethan Halton died in Nakamura Valley from injuries sustained during a crash while making a tight turn on one such track.\n",
    "Yellow Puglath": "The yellow puglath is a plant created by Rayari Inc. Derived from the ng.athxya, a plant indigenous the desert regions of Ka'ua (Hyoton IV), it was designed to capture as much water as possible from its surrounding environment. Specialized ridges along its trunk can capture early morning dew in arid climates, and its internal cells can collect up to a four liters of drinking water per day in ideal conditions.\n",

Along with the nearby planet Yethl\u016bl y.ath'o (Y\u0101'mon II), it is being jointly terraformed by the Human corporation ArcCorp and the Xi'an government. This long-term collaboration is expected to benefit both sides as they share their technologies and methods with one another. In 2948, the planet was flooded with a violet-hued gas as a step in the atmospheric construction process. Part of the Koa e Ko'ia endurance race took place on Yethl\u016bl s.yen'o in 2947.\n",
    "Yethl\u016bl y.ath'o (Y\u0101'mon II)": "Yethl\u016bl y.ath'o (Y\u0101'mon II) is the second planet from the sun of the Y\u0101'mon system, Xi'an Empire. Although it saw little use other than resource extraction during the Xi'an-Human Cold War (SEY 2530 - 2793), it is now a hub of activity as it is being terraformed under a joint project between the Human corporation ArcCorp and the Xi'an government. The main ArcCorp station in orbit around Yethl\u016bl y.ath'o is a popular destination for workers from either Empire to mingle. During the Koa e Ko'ia endurance race in 2947, the station reached maximum capacity as enthusiasts gathered there to watch the race.\n",
    "Y\u0101'mon System": "The Y\u0101'mon system (also known as the Hadur System) is a planetary system in the Xi'an Empire that consists of an F-type main sequence star, three terrestrial planets, a dwarf planet, and an asteroid belt. Discovered in 2529 by navjumper \u0100i se Cho'an, it was designated as a supply system for the Xi'an military and placed under its protection. In 2531, it was re-discovered by Human explorer Teesa Morrison when she traversed the Baker-Y\u0101'mon jump point and encountered a Xi'an military escort team. This incident led the United Planets of Earth (UPE) High Naval Commander Jianna Perry to propose that Xi'an systems connected to the UPE be placed under control of the Navy in case of an attack. It became the first system to form the Perry Line, and Humans renamed it Hadur after an ancient Human war deity. Under the terms of the 2789 Akari-Kr.\u0113 Treaty, it was ceded to the Xi'an Empire and reverted to its original name Y\u0101'mon.\n",
    "Y\u0101m\u2019ping (Y\u0101\u2019mon IV)": "Y\u0101m'ping (Y\u0101'mon IV) is a dwarf planet in the Y\u0101'mon system, Xi'an Empire, and is the last planet from its sun. Once home to several military outposts during the Xi'an-Human Cold War (SEY 2530 - 2793), Y\u0101m'ping is now orbited by stations dedicated to entertainment, such as gambling halls, bars, hotels, and other services. Xi'an and Human workers from the Yethl\u016bl y.ath'o (Y\u0101'mon II) and Yethl\u016bl s.yen'o (Y\u0101'mon III) terraforming projects often spend their time off here.\n",
    "Zeus": "The Zeus was a short-range spacecraft developed by Roberts Space Industries (RSI), and was the first ship equipped with a quantum drive to be offered to civilians on the commercial market. After the first quantum drive was developed by RSI for the military in 2075, demand for a civilian version grew until eventually the first commercial quantum-enabled spaceship prototype was produced during the 2130s. Known as the Zeus, the ship was not released until 2140 due to issues with hull integrity in its early test flights. After many project delays, RSI enlisted aid from Navy test pilot Michelle Saleno, the first Human to quantum travel beyond the orbit of Jupiter (Sol V). Saleno convinced the Amecanio Navy to form the 999th Test Squadron for the evaluation of cutting-edge spaceships, and the Navy agreed to use the 999th to help RSI refine the Zeus. After a complete overhaul of the Zeus's hull based on the advice of Saleno and the 999th, Saleno successfully piloted the Zeus in 2137. The availability of the Zeus was key in accelerating the early expansion of Humans beyond their home planet.\n",

The Cutter comes equipped with two laser repeater hardpoints and two dual missile racks.\n",
    "Ellis 5a": "Ellis 5a is the first moon of the planet Noble (Ellis V), United Empire of Earth (UEE). To the naked eye, it appears to be softly pink. In 2845, the prominent jewelry company Apgar's debuted a line of pink pearl necklaces inspired by Ellis 5a, made of pearls harvested from oysters cultured on Green (Ellis III). The clasp of each necklace was created from gold and silver harvested on Ellis 5a.\n",
    "Hull B": "The Hull B is a freighter developed by Musashi Industrial & Starflight Concern (MISC) as part of the Hull series of spacecraft. Designed to handle a larger cargo payload than the Hull A, the B model\u2019s monotasking focus on hauling means that while it is not as versatile as some other haulers in its class like MISC\u2019s own Freelancer-line, it is quite capable in its area of expertise. It is often utilized by corporations for space-terrestrial transfer.\n",
    "Hull D": "The Hull D is a modular bulk freighter produced by Musashi Industrial & Starflight Concern (MISC). The Hull D is the second largest freighter in the Hull line and is capable of transporting large quantities of goods attached to the frame in standard cargo containers. The Hull D is typically operated by mid-sized corporations or larger organizations and frequently serves as the flagship for mercantile groups.

Born on Cestulus (Davien II) in 2513, Melo's first job was as a political aid, leading to a brief career in campaign management, until he became a political correspondent for the United Times/Tribune. He was hired to replace show creator Upsana Dixit in 2546 as the host of Showdown! His confrontational style with the guests on the program led to a boost in ratings and became a part of the show's standard methodology even after Melo's retirement in 2588.\n",
    "Ita Hurston": "Chief Warrant Officer Ita Hurston (2512-2542) was a United Planets of Earth (UPE)Advanced Special Operations soldier who died in the First Tevarin War (2541-2546). The fourth moon of Hurston (Stanton I), Ita, was named in her honor.\n",
    "Kallis VIII": "Kallis VIII is the seventh planet from the sun of the developing Kallis system. An ice giant, it is composed of hydrogen, helium, and volatile icy compounds. In contrast to its neighboring planet Kallis VII, which began its life in the outer reaches of the Kallis system, it most likely formed closer to its sun and later migrated outwards to its current location beyond the frost line. One leading hypothesis suggests that during Kallis VII's journey inward, it may have displaced Kallis VIII.\n",
    "Kampos (Ellis IV)": "Kampos (Ellis IV) is the first settled and most populous planet in the Ellis system, United Empire of Earth (UEE). Famous for a unique ecosystem adapted to high gravity, Kampos is a favorite subject for xenobiologists, paleontologists, and evolutionary biologists. Its most well-known animal and namesake is the kamposi magnus, an extinct aquatic predator that once stalked the oceans.

    "Plain Truth": "The Plain Truth is a Human tabloid talk show broadcast by SSN/CAtv and hosted by former New United reporter Parker Terrell. It premiered in 2944, in the wake of a widely reported upon, three-month disappearance by Terrell. After his sudden reappearance, Terrell was fired by his former employers at the New United and established Plain Truth. The show is filmed on Terra (Terra III). It currently operates as an independent investigative unit, focusing on controversial and sensationalist Human interest and political stories. The show is often critical of the United Empire of Earth (UEE) government.\nParker Terrell was an investigative journalist with the New United for 11 years, where he developed a reputation for often combative political stories. He was sometimes censured by his employers for taking too much of an editorial stance in his columns, but as his articles drew in audiences, he was retained. On 19 June 2943, Terrell appeared on the debate show Showdown where he asserted on the air that the UEE used an illegal super-weapon to destroy the surface of the planet Ellis XI. He disappeared less than a week later. A missing persons report was filed on 30 June. No note was found, and Terrell\u2019s personal ship was missing from its hangar.\nTerrell\u2019s ship was recovered from Vann (Croshaw III) on 10 August 2943. Terrell himself was discovered shortly after, on 16 September 2943. The Advocacy brought him in for questioning and released him on the same day. On 08 October 2943, Terrell appeared on Showdown, where he asserted that \u2018shadowy government agents\u2019 had chased him into hiding and repeated his accusation that the UEE had tested a planet-killing weapon on Ellis XI. After he refused to recant, the New United NewsOrg chose to terminate his contract.\nTerrell was hired by SSN/CAtv on 11 October 2943 to develop a news show. The first episode of Plain Truth premiered on 01 April 2944. In it, Terrell interviewed Daniel Warden, an independent courier who had been stopped by UEE Customs upon his entry in the Helios system and unlawfully detained for three weeks. During his imprisonment, Warden was questioned by Advocacy agents about people he had never met and about his activities in the Nexus system. Following Terrell\u2019s broadcast, Warden received an undisclosed amount of credits as compensation from the UEE for his detention. Since then, Plain Truth has run on a weekly basis, and has enjoyed moderate ratings.\nWhile Plain Truth is billed as a purely investigative journalism-centered program, there has been criticism from other news organizations that the show promotes conspiracy theories rather than fact.\nIn 2945, Terrell interviewed Janis Tarkis, former journalist for the Terra Gazette. Tarkis asserted that the Galactic Aid Organization (GAO), a well-known charity that supplies those in need with cybernetic and artificial organs, had sold faulty organs on the black market for profit. After the episode aired, offices of the GAO across the UEE were inundated with comms accusing them of organ harvesting. Donations sharply dropped and multiple offices were vandalized. Terrell claimed no responsibility, stating that his job was to bring the truth to people, not dictate their actions. A subsequent formal investigation into GAO revealed no wrongdoing.\n",

One day on R.aip'u\u0101ng is equal in length to 100 Modern Xi'an Years (MXY), a coincidence with enough significance for it to have been turned into the spiritual center of Li'tova at the conclusion of the First Imperial Age (MXY I.0 - I.14680 / SEY 19668 - 878 BCE). Most of its surface is covered in verdant fields and cultivated gardens, with temples built so there is always one visible on the horizon no matter one's location. It is considered a huge achievement to meditate on R.aip'u\u0101ng for a full day, a feat achievable only by those who have mastered manipulation of their metabolic state. No manufacturing or mining activities are allowed beyond the essential in order to maintain tranquility, and most visitors to the planet are encouraged to limit their travels to the capital city and its immediate surroundings.\n",

The Mako includes bespoke equipment to support its broadcaster role, including an image enhancement suite and a turret-mounted optical array.\n",
    "System": "The term system is most frequently used by Humans as shorthand for planetary system, the grouping of all planetary bodies and other satellites that orbit a given star. The planets of a particular planetary system are by default given the name of the star itself followed by a roman numeral, ordered beginning with I as the innermost planet. Satellites of those planets are designated with an Arabic numeral matching the planet they orbit followed by a lowercase letter starting with a for the innermost moon. Less frequently, system may refer to a star system, a group of multiple stars which are impacted by one another's gravity and proximity.\n",
    "The Great Divide (Xi'an Civil War)": "The Great Divide (the Xi\u2019an Civil War) took place from 20044 to 19770 BCE. The outcome of millennia of inter-House conflicts and complex webs of enmity and allyship, it began when the last daughter of House Kl.\u014d attempted defection to House Uai'i. Hostilities between the Houses grew deadly, and Houses Chii and Ru'a were compelled to join a now system-wide civil war. The war concluded when members of House Kl.o sabotaged RyiXy'ans (Hyoton III) network of antique weather satellites, intending to assassinate the leadership of Houses Uai'i, Ru'a, and Chii during tentative peace talks. This inadvertently triggered a chain reaction that destroyed RyiXy'ans atmosphere, rendering the planet uninhabitable and killing millions. Survivors evacuated to the colony world Ka\u2019ua (Hyoton IV). The events of the Great Divide forced the Xi\u2019an to reassess their culture. The calendar was reset to I.0 (19668 BCE), the Civil Service was established, a new capital was established on Ka\u2019ua, and Ru\u2019a was elected to serve as the first Imperial House.\n",
    "Third Sister (Kilian III)": "The Third Sister (Kilian III) is a protoplanet in the Kilian system, United Empire of Earth (UEE) that orbits the system's sun in the L5 Lagrange point of the hot Jupiter First Sister (Kilian I). Glittering patches of ice can be found dotted across its surface. Because the UEE Navy utilizes the Third Sister as a testing ground for weapons, landing is prohibited without proper military clearance.\n",
    "Titus": "Titus is the most populous city on Selene (Vega III), United Empire of Earth (UEE), and the seat of the planet\u2019s government. Titus was once a center of commerce, but it experienced a sharp economic and population drop after the Fall of Virgil in 2737. While the city center is developed, there are abandoned construction projects on the outskirts that pose a continuous hazard to the populace. Recently, outside interests have begun purchasing this land in hopes of redeveloping it.\n",

Their head, the Legatus Marinuum, is one of the three military representatives who make up the position of High-Command. They are headquartered on Corin (Kilian IX). The Marines don't offer open recruitment; instead, they cherry-pick potential candidates from other branches of the military, and sometimes even the Advocacy.\n",
    "UEE Naval Flight Academy": "The United Empire of Earth Naval Flight Academy (UNFA) is a coeducational service academy located on MacArthur (Kilian V). Established in 2632, it is one of the oldest of the UEE\u2019s service academies. It educates officers for commissioning into the UEE Navy. Most graduates of the UNFA go on to the various combat squadrons in the Navy, but others may pilot capital or support vessels.\n",
    "United Nations of Earth Council": "The United Nations of Earth Council was the ruling body of the United Nations of Earth (UNE) government from its inception in 2380 until the advent of the United Planets of Earth (UPE) in 2523. It was made up of an elected representative from each of the states (then called nations) on Earth (Sol III). The Council\u2019s primary function was to exercise final approval of legislation that had passed through the Unified Senate, command the military, appoint diplomatic and judicial officers, and take the lead in policymaking. As the UNE expanded, Humans who resided on other worlds grew increasingly dissatisfied with their lack of representation on the Council. In response to this, the Council disbanded and was replaced with the Tribunal when the government transitioned into the UPE.\n",
    "Vanduul Raids": "Vanduul raids are attacks coordinated for the apparent purpose of harvesting or capturing resources. Raids vary in size; most are made up of a few Vanduul and employ quick hit and run tactics. Larger raids can sometimes include the deployment of \"Harvesters,\" large vehicles used to pull resources from the surface of planets and moons. Frequent Vanduul raids in a planetary system are sometimes precursors to invasion.\n",

    "Gammon Messer": "Gammon Messer (2629 - 2662) was the eldest child of ImperatorCorsen Messer V and actress Inaya Satti. He spent his childhood on Earth (Sol III) with his sister Illyana and his cousin Marius. Third in line from ascension at the time of his birth, he was raised without expectation that he become Imperator. He spent his youth pursuing hobbies and was rumored to have indulged heavily in vice. When Marius was killed in a shuttle explosion in 2643 and Corsen became Imperator, Gammon was suddenly first in line for succession. He was forced to attend military school at the behest of his father, and formally entered the UEE Army at age 18. In 2654, he married Colonel Yemi Duas in a lavish ceremony in New York City on Earth, which his sister Illyana did not attend. His only daughter Astrid was born in 2661. Before his assasination alongside his father in 2662, Gammon was credited with creating more intense prisoner conditions and devising particularly violent forms of information extraction, many believed to have been derived while accompanying Corsen on his many visits to the political prisons on Charon III.\n",
    "Genesis System": "The Genesis system is a developing planetary system that consists of a G-type main sequence star, a mesoplanet, a terrestrial planet, an ice giant, and an asteroid belt. Discovered in 2812, it was immediately evident that the second planet from the sun was lush with vegetation. Many terraforming companies put in early bids with the United Empire of Earth (UEE) government, but were ultimately barred from developing the system when the Fair Chance Act was invoked after multiple intelligent species were detected on Genesis II's surface. The system's other two planets are situated on either side of the green band, and are poor candidates for terraformation.\n",
    "Golem-Tek": "Golem-Tek is a Human retailer of industrial armor, EVA equipment, and flight wear. Founded in 2941, they market their stores to blue-collar workers, and tend to be located in heavy industrial areas. The company expanded into selling body armor and environment protection suits aimed at miners and salvage crews in 2944, with licensing agreements to offer products from Basilisk and Virgil Ltd.\n",
    "Groupe Nouveau Paradigme (GNP)": "Groupe Nouveau Paradigme (GNP) is a Human spacecraft component manufacturer that sells sensors, engines, and software. An unusually structured company, GNP was founded via an alliance between the governments of the Helios, Odin, Charon, and Baker systems in order to utilize facilities abandoned by the defunct FarSeer corporation. As a public company, GNP redirects all of its profits into further development and builds out facilities in the four aligned systems. Today, GNP produces the Tonnerre line of freighter power plants and the V601-11 RADAR used by the military for current-generation Hornet spacecraft.\n",
    "Hathor Group": "The Hathor Group was a Human inter-planetary mining concern that employed harsh, environmentally catastrophic techniques that left otherwise inhabitable planets desolate in the company's wake. It purchased the Nexus system from the United Nations of Earth (UNE) in 2468, strip mining the surface of Lago (Nexus IV) and ignoring burgeoning criminal activity in the system. New environmental protection laws established after the end of the Messer Era (2546 - 2792) resulted in the Hathor Group's dissolution in 2801.\n",
    "Haven": "Haven is a settlement on Tyrol V in the unclaimed Tyrol system. Built into the side of a deep canyon to shelter from the heat of the suns, Haven started as a collection of tunnels that were used as temporary hide-outs by outlaws with nowhere else to run. As more people desperate enough to disregard the looming risk of the nova have made their way to the system, Haven has grown into an interconnected warren of caves both natural and artificial. An underground river flows through the deepest part of Haven, providing a fresh supply of liquid water to its inhabitants.\n",
    "House Kr.\u0113": "House Kr.\u0113 is the current Xi\u2019an ImperialHouse. They first came to prominence during the Spirit Wars (II.961 - II.1735 / SEY 351-1342), gaining the attention of Imperial House Xy.\u014d for collecting volumes of strategically valuable intelligence on the Kr\u2019thak. Kr.\u0113 was Imperially sanctioned as the prime intelligence house in II.1138 (SEY 578). As one of the largest surviving houses after the end of the Spirit Wars, Kr.\u0113 was instrumental in reconstruction efforts. They were selected as the Third Imperial House in III.0 (SEY 1457). The infant U.e\u2019o se Kr.\u0113 became House Kr.\u0113's first Emperor. The current Emperor, T.u\u0113ng se Kr.\u0113, is the last member of his line.\n",
    "Hitbox": "Hitbox is a gaming magazine managed by C&K Publishing that releases a new issue every Standard Earth Month. Launched in December 2935, each issue of Hitbox features previews of upcoming games, news and statistics related to the games industry, reviews of new releases, and at least one interview with a game developer. This standard format is only broken in the December issue, which dives into a detailed retrospective on the best and worst games of the past year. After a rocky start, it has consistently been one of the top selling gaming magazines produced by Humans since reaching the mass market in 2939.\nRoommates Velma Bhatti, Amahle Mhlongo, and Augustin Fontenot began a Spectrum site called Collision Detection in 2929 containing short reviews of digital games they had recently played. Enthusiasts who first bonded with one another over their shared love of games, Mhlongo had recently obtained her Equivalency and was unsure of what to do next, and Bhatti and Fontenot were working restaurant jobs while they saved money to buy a Constellation Taurus. Initially, their reviews were posted on an irregular schedule, based on when one of the three could afford to purchase a new game. Their posts became more frequent in late 2929 when Mhlongo got a job at retailer Baers and was able to temporarily borrow games as a part of her store's employee check-out program. Views began to climb due to the site's more regular publication schedule and the shared sense of humor the friends included in each of their articles.\nIn 2931, the site was receiving enough views that Mhlongo suggested reaching out to advertisers to cover their ballooning hosting costs. Fontenot and Bhatti were reluctant to do so, as they did not want to be tied to maintaining a hobby site when they eventually saved enough to purchase their own spacecraft. However, as their bills continued to grow higher, they conceded that they could no longer afford to cover the costs on their own and they partnered with their first advertisers. They were soon able to cover their server bills with some money left over. The site continued to grow, eventually becoming profitable enough thanks to increased viewership and advertising revenue for all three to quit their jobs and dedicate themselves to reviewing full time in 2932.\nPublishing company C&K reached out to the trio in 2934 with an offer to publish Collision Detection as a physical magazine. The contract would provide the site founders with an influx of credits, enough for Fontenot and Bhatti to finally purchase their first ship. They eagerly signed, and Mhlongo threw herself into developing the format of the magazine while Fontenot and Bhatti focused on keeping the site maintained, updating it remotely from their ship as they fulfilled their dream of traveling. C&K took on the bulk of production planning, and after almost a year of preparation, the first issue was released in December 2935 under the new name Hitbox, which had tested well with focus groups. The site was renamed as well.\nInitial sales were disappointing. The first six issues struggled with confusing page layouts, and a screenshot of the game Canine Coiffure, long used by Bhatti as filler to be replaced before her articles were published, was mistakenly used for multiple unrelated games and sent to print until it was excised from the production pipeline. Even after the issues were resolved, it seemed that Hitbox was not destined to be a hit. However, sales picked up throughout 2937 thanks to a strategy devised by Bhatti. As she and Fontenot journeyed through the United Empire of Earth (UEE), they would drop free bundles of the magazine with games and electronics retailers along with the contact information of C&K Publishing. By 2939, Hitbox could be purchased at most places where games were sold.\nMhlongo remains at Hitbox as Editor-in-Chief, and Fontenot and Bhatti contribute reviews and special articles to the magazine and the site multiple times per year. The two married in 2943.\nIn 2941, the magazine was mailed a copy of a lost game titled Meet Me in Elysium, ostensibly made by a reclusive team of Tevarin who published their work under pseudonyms. Features Editor Gavin Joy wrote an in-depth article on the game with interviews from the developers that was published in the March 2941 issue of the magazine. The game was revealed to be an elaborate hoax concocted by Borea (Magnus III) radio hosts Burke and Banyon for the holiday Triggerfish. Hitbox published a written apology signed by all its editors in the April issue, promising to exert more due diligence in the future. Joy resigned.\n"
